Today we look at MAMP: the german server software for you.

Q: Apple lied to me, man!

A: How’s that again?

Q: They said every Mac has all the software needed to be a web server built in.

A: Which is true.

Q: Except for PHP, man! I wrote a php website and it totally didn’t get served. No service! Web server fail, I say!

A: Easy there, oddly phrased hippie person! So, you turned on the “Web Sharing” thing…

Q: …Put a php file in my “sites” folder…

A: …And it didn’t do what you wanted. Yeah, been there. There’s two ways to deal with that.

Q: Yeah? what are they?

A: First, you could just edit the Apache configuration file to load the php module

Q: You lost me at “edit”.

A: Or you could download MAMP.

Q: What’s that? It sounds like someone with the mumps saying mump.

A: Don’t be weird. MAMP is a program that gives you a Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP web server. So you can do all your awesome server side scripting simply.

Q: Sweet!

A: Sure! Simply start several servers… okay, enough alliteration. MAMP sets up a local copy of PHP, MySQL and Apache that all runs separate and apart from the bulit-in “web sharing” server, so you can hack away at it’s config files and not screw up your mac. It makes it much easier to turn your MacBook into a development server.

Q: Wait, what? My MacBook? What about my iBook?

A: Sure. It’s Universal.

Q: Cosmic.
