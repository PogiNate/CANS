Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we talk about something that people apparently do when they aren’t in grad school while working and raising kids: sleep.

Q: So, you’ve finally run out of mac software to make fun of, huh?

A: Hmmm? Wha? No. There’s ton of stuff out there. Thersa, thersa lotta software left. For example, I don’t think I’ve ever written about XCode!

Q: So, why don’t you do that one today?

A: Honestly? Because I’ve spent so much time in Visual Freakin’ Studio on Windows 7 that I can’t remember what Objective-C even looks…looks at trees.

Q: Trees?

A: Bah! Don’t you talk to me about trees. Especially binary trees.

Q: Why would Objective-C look at trees?

A: Everything looks at trees. We all have to look at trees. All day, every day. That’s basically all I do any more. Wonder why trees lose left children and leave off leaves.

Q: Normal human beings don’t have any idea what you’re talking about…

A: In a splay tree data structure…

Q: Whoa! Hey! I didn’t say we were interested! I just said we don’t know what you’re talking about. But you’re not talking about sleep.

A: Sleep is what happens when you decide that smashing the G, E, Z and F6 keys simultaneously with your face isn’t helping you get any closer to understanding right double rotations. Well, no; sleep is what happens after after you trip over the dog after deciding that smashing the G, E, Z, and F6 keys isn’t opening any doors in Windows or Linux or Mac, or Mac the Knife. That shark has pretty teeth, dear. Dear, that shark has pretty teeth.[1][1]

Q: I can’t decide if I should feel sorry for you or just walk away.

A: Why not both?

Q: In a minute. So, do you have anything to say to your disappointed fans right now?

A: Steely Dan is a far better band than the Eagles.

Q: Controversial and timely. Well done. Okay go trip over a dog.

A: Ten-four, Roger Wilco. I’ll see you in Space Quest II.
