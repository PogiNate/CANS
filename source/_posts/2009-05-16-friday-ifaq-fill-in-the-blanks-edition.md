Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we offer you the opportunity to write your own iFAQ with this handy template!

Q: I have a question about the new ---------. Can you help me?

A: Ah, yes, the ---------------. Do you have the --------------- Standard or the Pro?

Q: The Standard. I didn’t want to pay the extra ------------ dollars, just so I could --------------- without using a third party ----------------------.

A: Hmmm. Well, sometimes that will work, if you watch out for ------------------- or condensation, but you’re still going to lose definition in the --------------------. What is the problem you’re having?

Q: Well, whenever I try to spool up a ----------------- node, I get 75% too much ------------------ all along the regressor pathways.

A: Yeah, that’ll happen. Are you using an open-source --------------------- patch or the Microsoft one?

Q: Microsoft! I wouldn’t use the “Muckrosoft” version if they threatened to ----------------- my left ------------- all the way to Sheboygan.

A: Well, I realize that there are moral issues at stake, but in this case, It’s hard to deny that Microsoft ----------------s a good --------------------.

Q: Look, the only reason their version doesn’t ---------------------- is because they bought out --------------------, fired the ---------------------- department, and put all the engineers in --------------------- and re-branded it.

A: Still, if you want less --------------------- in your ------------------, you have to decide if you can deal with the -------------------------, or take the extra time for the --------------------- version to load your ---------------- files, respectively.

Q: Listen, if it’s a choice between a fuzzy -------------- or paying Mr. Ballmer ------------------ just so he can ---------------- my nodules, then call me Leo Laporte, ’cause this ----------------- don’t ----------------- with the monkeys.

A: Language! Please, we have reason to believe that young ------------------ read this blog on occasion! Well, if that’s how you feel about it, then you should probably try the free ---------------------, darken to 30% ------------------ per diem, then put in the sun and hope for the best!

Q: Better than ----------------------ing with the devil in the -----------------------------.
