Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: [Pixelmator][1], the image editor that isn’t as expensive as Photoshop, but also isn’t as ugly as [the Gimp][2]!

 [1]: http://www.pixelmator.com/
 [2]: http://www.gimp.org/

Q: Why you gotta say the Gimp is ugly?

A: Ummmm, because it is? I mean, X11? Seriously? 

Q: But it has so much power! It’s elegance is matched only by its–

A: Really crappy interface! And anyway, we’re here to talk about Pixelmator.

Q: Never used it.

A: What? That what possible questions could you have about it?

Q: None. Some shiny robot guy told me to come in here and ask questions or else he’d elegantly reformat my hard drive.

A: Well that’s just great! How am I supposed to write an iFAQ with a “Q:” Guy who doesn’t have any questions?

Q: You could ask me questions!

A: About a program you’ve never used?

Q: Yeah! Wait, no. Hmmm… I see your point.

A: Listen, just…just read these cards okay?

Q: This seems weird. I feel dishonest doing this.

A: Give ya a buck!

Q: Okay! Here goes. Ahem. “How will pixelmator make me mroe popular with the ladies?”

A: What? That’s not what I wrote! I would never misspell the word “more”!

Q: Well, yeah, but your question was boring! Anyway, if it can make me more popular with the ladies, then I might be interested.

A: Okay, whatever. Look, if you can make a real nice picture, with like, hearts and flowers and print it with the lady’s name in the middle and stuff, then maybe that’ll help a little bit.

Q: What if I don’t know her name? What if I always just call her sweet–

A: Then you have bigger problems. Now, can we please just ask image manipulation questions?

Q: Okay, fine. How can I make an image do my bidding?

A: What?

Q: Why else would I manipulate it? Other than to torture its psyche, that is.

A: Yeah, okay, we’re done here. 

Q: Don’t pretend you haven’t thought about it. And anyway, why haven’t you answered my question!

A: Well, you can warp, twist and blur your image. Does that help?

Q: A little. 

A: Fine. Bye now.
