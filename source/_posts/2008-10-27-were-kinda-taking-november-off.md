Okay, this year I’m gonna do it.  I’ve talked about it for the last few years, acted like it was gonna happen, but this year I’m really gonna do it.  I’m gonna make it happen.  That’s right; this year I’m participating in [National Novel Writing Month][1]![1][2]

50,000 words, 30 days.  I got some characters. I got an idea for a story. I got the software, I got the drive, I got the ambition. Sure, it’ll be a sacrifice.  I won’t get to write long, loving posts about my G1 when it gets here on the 10th. I won’t get to start the tradition of letting the Ruby Ninja Androids write a post on the day after Thanksgiving.  But it won’t be that bad. After all, It’s only 1666.66 words per day, and this post is already up to, what… 190 words[2][3] I’m in trouble.

I’ll post things here until November 1st, to get in shape and give you something to look back on during November. I’ll write posts next month as well, but they’re gonna be more novel related than Mac news. So if you hate terrible amateur novels, please tune back in on December 1st.  I don’t blame you. For those brave souls who hang on, don your sailor’s caps, because it’s [Terrible First-Draft Prose ahoy][4]![3][5]

1.  If I was into special effects there would be, like, fireworks or something here. [[↩][6]]
2.  I write posts non-sequentially. There were two sentences after this one when I wrote that.  I also added some stuff before it. Stop trying to figure out the numbers. Like counting John McCain’s houses: It’s just not possible. [[↩][7]]
3.  not that this is a major departure from my usual writing. It’s just less mac-themed [[↩][8]]
