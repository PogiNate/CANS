Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we cover Chill Pill, the little feed aggregator that isn’t.

A: You got the need to feed.

Q: I NEED to read.

Q: Indeed.

A: So, what’s the problem?

Q: I’ve got the fever…

A: Stand over there please.

Q: No, I mean, I’ve got the [fever feed aggregator][1] running on a server, but I hate using web browsers to browse the web.

A: The inside of your head must be a frightening place.

Q: Some times, my friend. Some times.

A: That to one side, your problem seems to be that you don’t like going on the web to get information from the web.

Q: You make it sound silly.

A: So, what is it you want?

Q: Yeahhh I really don’t pay much attention to things you say, so It’s unlikely that I’d remember that. You gonna help me or not?

Q: What’s that?

A: It’s a single site browser. And by ‘single site’ I mean it only browses your Fever page. You get all the features of a browser with out any of the freedom!

Q: And that’s a good thing now?

A: Well, it does a few things like let you re-theme your fever, and track how many new items you have, and stuff like that, but pretty much, yeah. Look, ask a stupid question, get a–

Q: AWESOME application! This is perfect! Now I can show off the fact that I’m so rich I spent thirty clams to run software on my own server to basically do what Google reader does for free! It’s the ultimate in hipster techno-snobbery!

A: I saw them once. They were opening for Ironic Grunge Retro. It wasn’t a very good show.

Q: Everyone will be all “oh hey, you must really be in to the news and stuff” and I’ll be all “nah, I just like to keep an eye on things, it’s no big deal” and they’ll think it’s really a big deal in their heads, but they’ll play it off like it’s nothing but I’ll know, Oh, I WILL KNOW that they are full of avarice-flavored angst.

A: This got off on an ugly tangent, so I’m gonna leave now, ‘kay? Okay.

Q: I mean, they’ll already kinda hate me for the way that I carry my big ol’ 17″ MacBookPro around everywhere, and how I spend five minutes whenever we meet somewhere setting up my Magic Mouse and my Magic Trackpad, but the fact that I’m throwing money at things that they do just fine for free will be the final nail in the cake, the frosting on the coffin that makes them start writing poems about my death. This is so much better that I even could have hoped for! Hey, where’d you go?
