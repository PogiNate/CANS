Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: [Bento][1], the database for people who don’t use databases.

Q: I run a local softball league…

A: Sure you do.

Q: …and I need to keep track of my players and their stats, averages, and addresses.

A: Uh huh. you’re a plant.

Q: No, seriously! I want to use Bento for my extracurricular activities! 

A: Nnnno. No, you’re a FileMaker employee trying to talk up the whole “personal database” thing.

Q: C’mon, be a sport. Just help me merge my address book with my team roster so I can conveniently send everyone reminder emails, because I’ve also imported my calendar from iCal!

A: [Reading WIkipedia] Holy cow! Your company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple, Inc. !

Q: We are not! My softball league is *sponsored* by the local power company. So we don’t have all that much money, and Bento seemed like a good way to capitalize on the power of my Mac without spending a whole bunch on new programs.

A: Mmmmhmmm. And I’m sure you’re just loving the “drag-and-drop” programming style. I mean, who does that? “Hey boss, I just drag-and-dropped a new version of the Safari browser, it’s got tabs on top now! and I sped up the JavaScript renderer!” “Great job! Good thing we don’t have to worry about code optimization!”

Q: I really don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m an accountant, and I like to play softball, and I have a Mac, and are you going to help me or not?

A: Look, Planty McShill, nobody, but nobody actually used Bento. Some people my download it. Some may actually buy it, but when you get down to brass tacks, it’s either a gussied-up version of the Address Book or it’s a dumbed-down relational database management system. Either way, it’s not a thing you “use” to “organize your life”. It’s more of a “symbol” of your “flock mentality” and you should be “ashamed of yourself.”

Q: I have a feeling this isn’t really the place to get help making my phone list part of a separate but accessible form.

A: That’s for sure. I’ve sure never been able to get it to work.

Q: I guess I’ll just go ask Dave down in Quality Assurance. After all, he wrote that feature.

A: I knew it! You *do* work for the company!

Q: And you have used Bento, or how would you know that you “couldn’t ever get that to work”?

A:…. Crap.
