Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we engage in [Omphaloskepsis ][1]and emerge with [OmmWriter Dāna][2], the serene plain text editor for you.

Q: Serene master, my brain is like a million monkeys with no taste for Elizabethan drama, yet I sense that, in the middle of this welter, there exists some grain of wisdom that I might share.

A: In what way do monkeys plague your thoughts, my son?

Q: Each monkey steals a bit of my brain, and many of them put my thoughts on Twitter without my knowledge. Others are conversely addicted to the flow of monkey thoughts from all that I know.

A: Ah, Twitter and Facebook monkeys are formidable enemies of the serene warrior.

Q: And yet another monkey has grown overfond of the taste of potted meat product!

A: Yes, the Spam Monkey is also a fearsome warrior of distraction.

Q: How may I combat these monkeys, oh venerable one?

A: I’m 32.

Q: What?

A: I’m 32, I’m not “venerable”.

Q: Well, I couldn’t just call you “one” now could I?

A: You could have called me Dennis.

Q: You’re not called Dennis. And you’ve completely destroyed our serene mystical thing we had going on with your needless nerdy pythonism. 

A: Look, I’ll level with you: OmmWriter can help. Quite a bit, actually. It tries hard to engage you both visually and aurally, so you’re less likely to break out and go look at email, because breaking from OmmWriter is a fierce jump, which slows your rate of random jumping. It also turns off your notifications via Growl, so you don’t see all the random stuff people show you.

Q: Ahh, and thus the monkeys are quietened. Thus may my true thoughts bloom as the lotus.

A: Indeed. 

Q: How much will I pay for this ally in the war for focus?

A: The developers, in their wisdom, have left your donation amount up to you. Pay as much as you feel is appropriate. 

Q: There is honor and merit in their actions.

A: As long as you pay more than $4.11. 

Q: I shall do so straighta–

A: Or use the free version.

Q: Freedom is a treasured asset, a prize to be sought with all –

A: But I would pay to support their efforts, if I were you.

Q: To give to another is to increase the wealth of one’s sel–

A: And make sure the amount you pay ends in a “1″, because the devs think that’s lucky, and we should let them be lucky.

Q: You’re just going to keep interrupting me, aren’t you?

A: Yep.

Q: Okay, I’ll go be serene by myself and check out this OmmWriter thing. We’re don–

A: Okay bye!
