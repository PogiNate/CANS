Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and  
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy  
Apple products.

In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each  
week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we  
will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.

This Week: iDVD

Q: Ummm…. I really can’t think of any questions about iDVD.  I mean, it’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it?

A: Is it?  Maybe there are more questions than you thought.

Q: No, not really.  I mean, you do all the hard work in iMovie, so when you export it into iDVD all you really have to do is choose a menu style and you’re golden.

A: That *may* be true.  Or perhaps… perhaps your limited mind isn’t ready for the awesome power that is iDVD.

Q: Hmmm… Nope, nope, I just read the iDVD help file. I don’t see any “awesome power” section.  Just different ways to set up menus.

A: Perhaps you are asking the wrong sort of question to fully unlock the grandeur of iDVD.

Q: I think I would need to unlock the grammar of that sentence first.

A: That’s the pot calling the kettle stupid[1][1] .  But go. I see you are not yet ready. You do not have the thirst for knowledge, for ultimate DVD-authoring power, that marks one of the truly prepared users of **iDVD: Master of Secrets**.

 [1]: #footnote_0_95 " Yes, I know how the saying is supposed to go. I just changed it for slightly comedic effect. Please don’t go around correcting my aphorisms."

Q: Whoa whoa whoa, no fair giving programs subtitles all willy-nilly[2][2]. Besides, “**iDVD: Master of Secrets**“? Sounds like some kind of stupid B science fiction sequel.

 [2]: #footnote_1_95 "Did you know that “willy-nilly is a corrupted form of “will he or nill he”? Now you know what that ridiculous word means!"

A: Those who mock iDVD are not ready for its secrets. I will answer no more questions today. Farewell.

Q: Well, actually I did have one question…

A: Really? Okay! I’ll answer it! What’s your question? Tell me tell me!

Q: Gotcha!  I don’t actually have a question about **iDVD: The Most Straightforward Program**.  I just wanted to see how long you could hold out not answering a question.

A: Ahem. Yes, begone with you! No longer may you insult the oracle of iDVD’s power.  I shall return now to… oh whatever. I’m going home. Jerk.

1.  Yes, I know how the saying is supposed to go. I just changed it for slightly comedic effect. Please don’t go around correcting my aphorisms. [[↩][3]]
2.  Did you know that “willy-nilly is a corrupted form of “will he or nill he”? Now you know what that ridiculous word means! [[↩][4]]
