We here at CANS are saddened at the loss of Mark Papermaster, recently axed VP of device hardware engineering. Instead of pointing at all the “i-word” possible reasons for him being axed, we thought we would instead take a look back at all the highlights of his time at Apple. Mark, this is for you.

> According to sources who spoke with The Wall Street Journal, Papermaster’s departure came as a result of a “falling out” with Jobs. How much the iPhone 4 antenna controversy played a part in his exit was said to be “unclear,” as those anonymous sources said the departure was chiefly a result of “cultural incompatibility.”

Ummm…yeah. that’s pretty much all we knew about Mr. Papermaster, except for the fact that he had an awesome name. Well, anyway, he’s gone. And so it goes.
