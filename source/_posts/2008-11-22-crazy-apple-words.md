While I was writing my little book I came across this site that makes a pretty cloud out of the words or RSS feeds you give it. So I fed it this site and this is what I got back…er, It’s a java thing, so I’m not going to embed it.  [But here’s the link. ][1]

Book is going well, I should finish well before the end of the month. I’m talking, I’ll have hours to spare. Thank you both (okay, thanks to all the lurkers as well) for your patience.
