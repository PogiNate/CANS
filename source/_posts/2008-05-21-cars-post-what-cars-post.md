Okay, okay, don’t panic. Just because CARS just got a post is no reason to freak out.  I mean, it’s not a real [CARS][1] post, is it? It’s just a link to a [Macworld][2] article.  An intelligent, well thought out, and fairly funny Macworld article.  Um… maybe no one will notice.  Maybe it’ll just go away on its own.  Let’s just… let’s just pretend we didn’t see it. That’ll work.

Oh, and don’t click on these links.  There’s nothing to see out there.
