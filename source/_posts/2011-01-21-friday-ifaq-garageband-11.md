Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we once again look into the best way to nurture your musical side with the newest GarageBand.

Q: What need have I, the Swan of Avon, for a band of garages?

A: Oh, hey cool, we haven’t done a character piece for a while. Okay, here goes. Forsooth! Yon mouldy poesy hath need of most vivacious melody, hathen’t it?

Q: Your words are to me as the barking of scabrous dogs. I have no need to lay down tracks and master my mix. I’truth, I have gained no small reputation as a mixmaster in yon pub “the Queen’s Boar”.

A: Full well cognizant of the impossibility of e’en the smallest part of this dialog, yet I press on, wondering aloud how one mixes in renaissance England.

Q: Verily, through skillful direction of not one, but two groups of musicians, I am able to concoct melodic mashups between such diurse sources as “[A Gest of Robyn Hode][1]” and “[My Lady Hath an Ample Posterior][2]“.

A: Verily, I can but hope that I am never subject to sickness such that I enjoy such diversions. But should such be your wont, then you would do well to inspect this latest product from the great Apple, that which more fully facilitate your entwinings and manipulations.

Q: Faugh! What could Apple provide me that I cannot provide myself?

A: A more firmly-grounded version of historical English?

Q: I dothe notte see thine pointte. My English isn’t wandering at all! What’cho talkin’ ’bout, Willis?

A: Be that as it may, GarageBand has many features in which you should be interested. It will attempt to coerce all your tracks to fit a single rhythm.

Q: Indeed, that may be of some passing value during the middle-8 bridge[1][3] .

A: So, buy it.

Q: Indeed? Thus you end our repartee?

A: Yeah. Sleepy now.

1.  I’ll level with you: I have no idea what that phrase means. I just hear musicians say it a lot. [[↩][4]]
