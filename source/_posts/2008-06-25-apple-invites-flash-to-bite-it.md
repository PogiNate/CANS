With the adoption of [Sproutcore][1], a new fancy Javascript framework, Apple has sent a message to competing “Let’s make the web look like a desktop” systems.

“Bite our already-bitten logo, open source hippie freaks!”  suggested Phil Shiller.  When reminded that both Flash and Silverlight were proprietary, he then cordially invited Adobe and Microsoft to “Bite our already-bitten logo, corporate fascist dictator punk zombie freaks!”

“We will be using Sproutcore as the basis of iPhone enabled web apps,” says Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone software.  When asked about support for other “Rich Internet” platforms like Flash, Forstall recommended that Flash developers “stick it up their CVS repository” and “get with the future, which belongs to Sproutcore”.

Apple watchers haven’t been able to get enough of putting the word Sproutcore into their articles over and over again, to the point where it has almost eclipsed “SDK 2.0.”

When asked for a comment, Apple encouraged us to “take a flying leap.”
