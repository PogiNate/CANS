![iDisk is now the prettiest princess!][1]Apple took iDisk in a new direction with the release of Mobile Me.  
For years, the iDisk icon has been the now-all-too-familiar “some kinda network-magic-ball” on a hard disk, suggesting that an iDisk is, well, a hard drive on the network (or possibly the other way around. I’m not sure.) Now, however, the iDisk icon invites you to explore something entirely new. Specifically, it invites you to explore worlds where you can ride with your improbably-proportioned friends on a magical wingéd horse named Feathers into a fluffy cloudy mauve external disk in the sky.  
This is a movement sure to be met well with the under-12 crowd, a group that makes up a significant number of Apple computer purchasers.  
“I like it a lot!!!!!!” said a person who was not allowed to tell me their name because “Mommy said I shouldn’t talk to bloggers”. “It’s a cool new picture, and I can store all my paintings of princesses on it! It’s so pretty! I named it “pretty fairy”! And I like the prple [sic] color too!”  
While we at CANS would never admit it, using the new iDisk makes us feel like royalty. *Pretty* royalty. Not, like, [Prince Charles][2] or anything.
