Apple humor columnists have been laid a stymie recently with Microsoft’s announcement that they will be opening their own retail outlets.  
“The problem isn’t having something to say about these impending train wrecks,” said [the Macalope][1], “the problem is knowing where to *begin*. It’s like trying to take a brand new Mac Pro and a 30″ Cinema Display out to your brand-new luxury sedan. You just can’t leave anything behind, but you don’t want to carry it all, in case you drop something.”

“This is more ground than any of us can cover alone,” cried John Moltz, proposing a new joint humor campaign to fully exploit the comedic potential of the guaranteed failure. However, the erstwhile [CARS][2] editor-in-chief then realized that starting and abandoning [yet][3] [another][4] blog would cut drastically into his time spent drinking sexy techno-whisky, and decided to cut out the middleman and abandon the plan instead.

“They haven’t got a [expletive deleted] snowball’s chance in [incredibly long string of expletives deleted]” ranted[ John Gruber][5], who isn’t a humor columnist *per se*, but is still pretty funny.

Fortunately, while those of us who are dedicated to making light of all things Apple were overcome by the majesty of Microsoft’s proposed flop, others were able to [handle the situation with aplomb][6]. From all of us to both of you, our thanks.
