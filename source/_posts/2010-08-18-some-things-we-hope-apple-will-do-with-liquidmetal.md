Apple now has the [exclusive right][1] to use the new Liquidmetal alloy-thing for electronical type communication devices and whatnot. Everyone make the Terminator jokes now. I’ll wait here.

Thank you.

Now, that done, here are some things we hope John Ive does with this new, insanely useful metal:

*   Actually Build EVE from Wall*E
*   Actually build Wall*E from Wall*E
*   Mac Wars Episode VI: RETURN OF THE CUBE
*   Shiny-backed iPhones That **don’t **pick up millions of fingerprints (because it’s magic!)
*   Newer, more powerful Phil Schiller 
    *   For that matter, it’s about time to redo The Woz. The current model is getting kinda ragged.
*   bullet-proof mock turtlenecks
*   Liquid. Metal. Ponies.
*   Summer Glau 2.0: Don’t call her “Autumn”

Well, we’ve wandered a bit from our main point. Here’s to Jony Ive and his shiny new toy. We look forward to the next coolest thing in industrial design.
