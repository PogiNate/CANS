**Tim Cook**: Listen, guys, we’ve got to get this right. 

**Phil Schiller**: Okay, sorry, Tim. We’re ready this time.

**Cook**: Good. Okay, one, two, three, four!

**Peter Oppenheimer**: A-wheem a way, a wheem a way…

**Jony Ive**: In the iMac, the peaceful iMac, Lion’s been installed!

**Scott Forstall**: De-we-um-um-a-way!

**Ive**: On the MacBook, the 13” MacBook, Lion’s been installed!

**Forstall**: WEEEEEEEEEE-de-de-de a Whum-a-way!

**Schiller**: Hush my darling, iOS and Lion, share lots of good ideas. Full-screen apps and, gestures for actions, make Lion excellent!

**Forstall**: Hey! Hey! Whoa-a-wo! Whoa-a-wo a Wheem-o-whum-whum-a-way!

**Schiller**: Wait, wait, Tim, he’s doing it again.

**Cook**: What’s wrong Phil?

**Schiller:** Scott keeps singing his weem-o-whum-a-ways over the top of my words.

**Ive:** Also, I only have one line, despite the fact that I’m the best looking of us. 

**Forstall:** I’m angry that my verse about beta testers being amazing was cut!

**John Mayer: **I’m mad that I’m not invited to sing at these events any more

**Cook: **Who let lizard boy in here? [on intercom] Security! John Mayer broke in again.

**Oppenheimer:** I still think it should be pronounced “Wheem o whip!”

**Forstall:** Look, Pete, we’ve been over this. That’s clearly not how you say it—

**Schiller:** Why are we worrying about how you say it? We should just worry about the fact that Scott keeps singing over my lines!

*[everyone starts talking at once. Jony Ive seems to just be saying “rhubarb, rhubarb!” over and over again]*

**Cook: **Listen, Listen! Guys, we’ve got to get this right!

**Schiller: **Okay, sorry, Tim. We’re ready this time.
