Q:….

A: Um, hello?

Q: Dear Diary, I’m so glad I have a place to store my thoughts, safe from the world, away from those that judge me.

A: Actually this is out on the web, I don’t know if you are typing in the right window.

Q: It was another hard week! People can be so mean sometimes! >:( They don’t think about how others feel when they talk, and so they just say things. I guess I’m rambling, but it’s just hard.

A: Look, this is supposed to be *about* MacJournal, not an actual journal *entry*.

Q: Still, I know that I’m doing my best, and that’s what matters, right? I mean, who cares if it’s good enough for all those others? I’m a valuable person! I shouldn’t have to worry about them, right?

A: Right! Sing it.

Q: …Well, I can tell myself that all I want, but it doesn’t heal the hole in my heart that they caused with their thoughtlessness. I understand what Simon and Garfunkel meant when they sang about being a rock, an island. Some days I just want to curl up in my room and eat rocky road ice cream straight out of the carton all day. 

A: We’ve all been there. Except I prefer Neapolitan.

Q: But I don’t. That would be letting them win! So I stand back up, put the spoon down, take a long, hot bubble bath, put on my best dress and heels, do my makeup and go out to face the world! 

A: Good job, sister! Don’t let ‘em get you down!

Q: Oh don’t I wish. Every time I try that, they just laugh harder. But some day, *some day*, they’ll all respect me.

A: *We* respect you. You go girl! We got your back.

Q: Well, tomorrow’s another day, I guess. I’ll write more then, but now it’s time to get into my jammies. I know you’re just a program, but thanks again, MacJournal! You’re my best friend.

A: No problem.

Q: Love and kisses
