Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we look at a program that’s dear to our heart: [Scrivener][1].

Q: Oh come on. You’ve been doing Scrivener-heavy posts since you started this site.

A: True, my friend, but it’s never had it’s own iFAQ.

Q: That can’t be right. You wrote a Scrivener iFAQ just last… wait, no, I’ll find it…

A: Hmm, yes, that supposed old post is hard to find, no?

Q: Well, I guess you haven’t done a Scrivener iFAQ.

A: Or perhaps it’s just… *disappeared*!

Q: Yeah, no. Given your track record you probably just forgot to write it that one week.

A: You know who makes people forget things? GHOSTS. Perhaps you read my old Scrivener iFAQ and your memories of that moment have just been… spirited away.

Q: Dude, stop it. So, why should I use Scrivener? Why not, say [Storyist][2], [Ulysses][3], [WriteRoom][4], Or [StoryMill][5]?

A: Do not mention the names of those hulking wrecks in my presence![1][6] I bring to you the name of the one angel of goodness and utility and you sully the conversation with sycophants and hangers-on!

 [6]: #footnote_0_990 "Note to people who like those hulking wrecks: Some of them are pretty good programs. I have purchased licenses to all of them except Ulysses. Ulysses makes rats barf."

Q: That’s…not really what I did at all…

A: Silence! You dare come to my huge crumbling neo-Victorian mansion seeking shelter from the driving rain, and then insult me in my own huge, wood-paneled study with a giant Grandfather clock ticking ominously in the corner!

Clock: TICK…TOCK…TICK…DOOM…TOCK

Q: How did you even get that thing into the studio?

A: That’s nothing, wait until I really get going and start playing my huge pipe organ. Would you like to see my mighty…

Q: Stop it.

A: Sorry. Now, where was I? right, clock, right. Ahem. When I pronounce to you that Scrivener is the most sublime of all writing programs, you can be assured that my statement comes from the wisdom of the ages. Ages through which I have lived and lurked, watching humanity from behind leaden glass, their pomposity and self-importance turning my stomach. Worms. But now the time has come. Now I will have–

Thunder: CRASHHHH! BOOOM![2][7]

 [7]: #footnote_1_990 "We only paid for a “Crash”, but Thunder is a bit of a ham"

A: My revenge!

Q: By advocating people use a good non-linear word processor?

A: Aha! That is but the first step in my plan! A plan so devious, so soul-shaking that strong men will quail and strong women will continue to be really good at stuff![3][8] Quail, then, mere mortal, at the sheer audacity of my plan!

 [8]: #footnote_2_990 "Have you ever noticed that? My wife is ten times better than me at most things. I mean, she’s driven forklifts on the docks of a salmon processing plant in Alaska, then went inside and fixed some giant machine with some duct tape and a wrench. What’s that all about?"

Q: … I still don’t know what your plan is.

A: Indeed, indeed you don’t! But you shall…after I write a 50,000 word novel about it in November! Then the whole world shall know my plan! Bwahahahahaha!

Thunder: CRK-CRK-BOOOOOOM![4][9]

 [9]: #footnote_3_990 "This one was completely improvised, but we kept it."

Q: So your evil plan is…to take part in NaNoWriMo.

A: And write a novel so terrifying, so soul-shaking that your very soul will be shaken!

Q: Okay, then have fun with that. I’ll just–

A: THERE’S A SPIDER ON YOUR HEAD!

Q: I’ll just be over here. Outside this door. Leaving.

A: Time to start playing the organ!
