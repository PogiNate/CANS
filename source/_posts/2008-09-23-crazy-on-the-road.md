So, The Crazy Apple News Crew (CANC?) leaves early tomorrow morning to go to Colorado for a day.  We’re going by plane (but by biplane. This is the 21st century, not the 19th.), so the title doesn’t really make any sense at all. But my question to you all is: What does one do when one is in Fort Collins?  We will immediately post any and all Crazy Apple News Items((CANI? Sounds like an Italian dish.)) we come across in our travels.  And by “immedately” I mean, “Whenever we can get a network connection. Some of us don’t have iPhones, ya know.”

So, to sum up: What does one do in Fort Collins and expect some microblogging from the road. Hopefully.

Okay, over and out.
