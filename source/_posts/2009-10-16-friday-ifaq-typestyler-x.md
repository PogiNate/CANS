Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we continue our look at all things textish with a blast from the past: [Typestyler X][1], the revived version of Typestyler!

Q: Hey, wow! Typestyler is back! I loved that program on my ol’ Flower Power iMac!

A: Yep! It’s back and better than ever!  Typestyler X makes full use of OpenGL, Quartz, CoreImage–

Q: And a website that was apparently designed in 1991!

A: What?

Q: Do *you* even click on your links?  Their website looks like it was designed on Dreamweaver 1.0 using MacPaint.  I mean look at this button:

A: Well, yeah, it’s not the best ever, but you can’t judge the program on the website…

Q: Wait, why not? They’re selling software that’s designed to make beautiful buttons, logos, etc. and this is what they have on their own site? I mean, here’s a better button I created in 40 seconds in ArtText2:

A: Well, they’ve been so busy getting the new version out, and things have been difficult, I’m sure.

Q: They’ve had *seven years*! Seven. Years.  And they hadn’t thought to update the graphics on their site in that entire time?  And somehow based on the strength of this website, *sans* screenshots, *sans* example files, they expect me to drop $200 for something that [ArtText][4] does for less than $40?

A: Well, Typestyler has a long tradition of being…wait, $200?

Q: Do you have an existing license?

A: No…

Q: Then you get to pay $200.  Do not pass go, do not collect squat.

A: Ouch. But wait! I’m sure the program rocks!

Q: Honestly, if you didn’t love it as an OS 9 program you won’t be impressed. It still looks a lot like OS 9.  Old. School. I mean, it’s powerful, and it’s got good features, but it’s ugly and hard to use.

A: Man, that’s harsh.  Which is usually my role.

Q: Yeah, you kinda didn’t answer any questions this week.

A: Well, I learned about ArtText, and that’s something.

Q: Good for you! That’ll be $200.
