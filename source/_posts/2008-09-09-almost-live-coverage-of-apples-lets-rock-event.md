We’re live here in, well, our office, and covering Apple’s groundbreaking event.

*   Steve looks like he always does.
*   He’s not dead.
*   iTunes 8 will tell a “genius in the cloud” that you want to make playlists based on the music of Zamfir and give you a list of songs that will sound good in a mix with pan pipes.
*   Is this the same cloud where Mobile Me lives?
*   iPods!
*   New Nanos! They look suspiciously like the iPod Giga!
*   That’ll be announced next. You just watch.
*   Here it comes.
*   …Or new earbuds. That’s good too.
*   And a flying rainbow.
*   Of nanos.
*   Wow! the new iPod touch looks just like the old iPhone! Kinda!
*   Nike built in! If only I ever used that, or even wanted to!
*   Iron Man! I’ll bet he has an iPhone.
*   Why does John Meyer keep showing up in people’s playlists?
*   Spore! Wow! that’s…something we all knew about. Phil looks good, though.
*   It’s like Phil has never seen an iPod before. What’s that all about?
*   It’s like he wants to, say, kiss each and every pixel on the screen.  Odd.
*   If I was going to play soccer on my iTouch, it’d be Philippines vs. Finland.  Yeah!
*   Why do games get all the accelerometer support?  I want a “shake and calc” spreadsheet for the iPhone!
*   This is the funnest iPod ever”  Is “funnest” a word?
*   Updates for money? What is Apple thinking?
*   Here comes the Giga. It’s a “One more thing” type of announcement.
*   No! No John Mayer! Please! NO! Oh, It’s Jack Johnson. That’s alright then.
*   Jack Johnson “Let’s Rock” = Mellow, acoustic sounds. Huh.
*   At least we avoided John Mayer. I can’t stand that little rodent.
*   I’d be sleeping right now, but there’s all this static.
*   Aaaand another song.
*   In what way is Jack Johnson “used to 20-something girls”?
*   I don’t want to think about Jack’s friends watching him sing love songs to his wife. I really don’t.
*   Well, that’s all folks. Until next time!
