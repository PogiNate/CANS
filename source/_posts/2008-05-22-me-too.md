Since it worked so well for my [most formidable predecessor][1], all I’m putting in this post is a [link to a post][2] I wrote about [Delicious Library][3] on my other site. It’s not as big as [Macworld][4], but hey, I’ve got about 10 dedicated readers on that site! And some T-shirts for sale!

That article started out as a post for this site, but isn’t very funny. Please, no comments about this site not being very funny either.
