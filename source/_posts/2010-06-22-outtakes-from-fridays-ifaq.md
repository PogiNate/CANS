Since we actually got an iFAQ out the door on Friday we figured we’d celebrate by giving you a sneaky peek into the parts that don’t make it into the final edit, the footage that hits the cutting room floor. And hopefully by so doing we will also give you a greater appreciation for all the work we do around here while you’re out gallivanting around with your fancy friends.

Anyway, here’s the clips:[1][1]
