Cupertino, California – Apple Inc., the makers of the wildly popular iPod and iPhone portable devices announced today that they will be launching an operating system that “will have changed the way we use comptuers” in 1984.  The announcement comes just hours after Google announced that they will be releasing a new operating system in the future.  
“We have two major releases scheduled,” said Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple. “One, in 1984, changed the way people thought about computers, moving from a command-line interface to a more elegant and user-friendly “Graphical User Interface” that had never been seen before in a “personal computer”  We will have been very proud of this, and considered it a major leap forward. 
“We are also working on a newer version which we are projecting for a 2001 release date. It was called Mac OSX, and we are predicting that it brought the advances that were made by the NeXT computer company to the mainstream, and allowed people to work more productively than ever before. Furthermore, OSX will  “evolve”, until, around 2009, we foresee it being a major contender in the OS marketplace.”

Jobs was quick to acknowledge the challenge facing the personal electronics manufacturer.  “It’s entirely possible that my own company will have sacked me, only to beg me to come back ten years later.  But there’s no way to know what will have happened unless we go back and move ahead.”

When asked how they felt the fledgling OS will fare against previous rival Microsoft Windows and IBM OS/2, Jobs replied, “We will have to had wait and see, you know? Time has told.”

It is also possible that Apple will join Microsoft and Google in releasing operating systems in the future. However, when Google Chrome launches in 2010 the release of Snow Leopard will also be in the past.
