Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

Today, in response to user input, we are doing our first ever iPhone App article![1][1] So sit back and learn all about the many uses of the Kindle App for the iPhone!

 [1]: #footnote_0_373 "Except for the Fromage one.  So we’re really doing our first ever iPhone app iFAQ"

Q: I can’t read me enough books!

A: Me neither!

Q: So I was six kinds of excited when the new Kindle app came out, because it meant I didn’t have to buy non-Apple hardware!

A: Very loyal of you. So you just loaded it into your iPhone or Touch and were glad you saved the $350, huh?

Q: Weeeeeell, I had to go buy a touch first.

A: But you were planning on buying one anyway, right?

Q: Nope, not really.

A: So, you bought an iPod Touch just so you wouldn’t have to buy a non-Apple Kindle.

Q: Yeah. I figured, I’ve already got a 120 GB Classic, I don’t really need another iPod, but books, well, that’s something different. I have to carry my Kindl…Touch and my Classic in different pockets, though. [2][2]

 [2]: #footnote_1_373 "Because they fight. You didn’t see it in the last article, but the Classic makes fun of the touch for not having a click wheel."

A: You still use the Classic, even though you just bought a Touch. You must have a lot of music.

Q: Oh yeah! I’ve got, like 5 GB of songs on that bad boy. Do you know how long it would take to listen to all that?

A: About two and a half…

Q: *Two and a half days!*

A: So you have a 120 GB Classic in one pocket, nearly empty, and an iPod Touch in the other pocket, with no music, just the Kindle app. 

Q: Wait, you can put *music* on an iPod Touch? I thought they were just for accelerometer games! That’s what the ads show!

A: Well, at the end of that first ad The Hands use Cover Flow to find one of my favorite albums ever,[3][3] but yeah, that’s what the ads show.

Q: What else can you do with it?

A: Um… Everything? Check email, weather, keep your calendar, use different apps from the App Store besides the Kindle app…

Q: What? The App Store isn’t all just accelerometer games and fart sounds?

A: Well, that’s most of it, sure, but there are other things as well.

Q: Wow. Now I’m really glad I bought the Touch instead of a real Kindle. I figured the extra price was worth it just for the color screen, but now…wow. Just wow.

A: And we wonder why we’re in a recession.[4][4]
