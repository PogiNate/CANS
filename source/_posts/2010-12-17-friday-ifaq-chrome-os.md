Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products. 

This week we look at the newest player in the OS game: Chrome OS.

Q: Why do we need a new OS? Especially one that’s basically just a browser? 

A: Heck, why not? I mean, Chrome’s a pretty sweet browser, right?

Q: Sure, but–

A: And you like having things boot up quickly, right?

Q: Well, who doesn’t? But that’s not the point–

A: Well then I fail to see what your problem is. Is it that you hate Christmas, Mr. Grinch?

Q: Ah, the sweet smell of seasonal *ad hominem* attacks. How about this, hot shot: What do you do with your beloved Chrome OS when you’re not in range of a wireless or Verizon cell tower?

A: Well, that’s what books are for.

Q: So the best thing to do in case of network outage is to run straight back to the arms of Johannes Gutenberg, then?

A: Well, you could use a Kindle…

Q: And that’s kind of my point. I could buy a MacBook Air–

A: I can’t. How much do they pay you?

Q: And when I didn’t have a wireless connection my MacBook Air would still be useful. A Chrome OS laptop would be a very sleek, instant-on paperweight.

A: Seriously, First you’re standing in line for an iPad, now you’re saying you can buy MacBook Airs all willy-nilly. I’m doing this for my slim cut of our slim advertising revenue.

Q: People come for the star power baby. But you haven’t answered my question. Why should I limit myself when I can get all of the Chrome *OS* functionality on any other computer by just installing the free Chrome *browser*?

A: Maybe you should just go buy an answer to your question, Mr. Trump. It’s more than my job’s worth to answer questions like that, mate.

Q: So yeah, there’s no good reason to buy a Chrome OS laptop.

A: Especially since Google’s almost inevitably going to merge Chrome OS with Android at some point.

Q: Aha! there is an answer.

A: Look, Google’s good at a lot of things, but being really firm and steadfast in one thing ain’t one of them. They like to play far too much to make it a good bet to get in on the ground floor of anything that requires you to put money on the table. Stick to GMail, Chrome the Browser, and regular ol’ google searches, and remember what happened to all those people who tried to make business cases around Google Wave. 

Q: “All those people”?

A: Well, Gina Trapani wrote a [book][1] about it.

Q: Yeah.

A: So, one thumb down[1][2] for Google Chrome the OS, one thumb up for the browser. Happy now?

 [2]: #footnote_0_1016 "if the letter A has a thumb"

Q: Very. Well, I’m off to go spend more money than you make in a year. Later!

A: Rrrrgh. It’s a consonant’s world, I tell you.

1.  if the letter A has a thumb [[↩][3]]
