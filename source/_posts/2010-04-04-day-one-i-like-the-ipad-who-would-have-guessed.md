So, after staining in line for an hour in the cold mountain air, I got my iPad and have come to some completely un-startling conclusions:

- The iPad is pretty big.  
- It really is very fast, which shouldn’t be a surprise, because everything it’s running was designed for it.  
- The multitouch and the keyboard are fine. I’m typing this on the new WordPad app for iPad.  
- People who just dropped hundreds of dollars for a device rarely complain about said device.  
- Stephen Fry was right: Douglas Adams would have loved this thing.
