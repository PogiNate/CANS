While the “[Chuck Norris Fact][1]s” thing is generally recognized as over, new research suggests that Mac users got away from the craze earlier than Windows users.

“It is suspected that Mac users are more up to date and urbane than their windows using counterparts,” noted John Hopkins of Johns Hopkins University, adding, “So Mac users wouldn’t say something like ‘Chuck Norris ordered a Big Mac at Burger King, and got one’ at the end of a quote like this.”

“Oh come on!” replied [Paul Therott][2], “Everyone still loves Chuck Norris facts. Look: I just made one up: ‘Chuck Norris *can* upgrade directly from Windows 95 to Vista’ See? Hilarious!” Steve Ballmer was similarly incensed. “Chuck Norris-based humor is a major cornerstone of all modern operating systems. Windows 7 won’t boot up, it’ll be roundhouse-kicked into functionality instantly.”

[John Gruber][3], however, felt that the findings of the study “were exactly what I expected. I mean, no one is going to laugh at something like ‘ Chuck Norris doesn’t wear a watch, HE decides what time it is.’ Heh. Hee hee hee. Hmph. Hmmm. Excuse me. Nor are we impressed to hear that ‘Chuck Norris counted to infinity – twice’. We’re urbane, busy, intelligent people who have to argue about what Apple is going to name [10.6][4].”

Others in the Mac world have taken a different tack, seeing now as a perfect time to capitalize on the Chuck Norris wave by attributing hyperbolic attributes to their favorite media icon.

“David Allen doesn’t read books, he just puts them into his inbox until they are filed under @home @read,” writes [Merlin Mann][5], who admits that his “David Allen facts” are a long way from being T-shirt worthy.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Linux users were seen hoarding Chuck Norris references against a time when they would be funny again, [as they have done][6] with other web memes.

Apple was contacted for a comment, but all they would say is that their favorite fact is:

> Chuck Norris has the greatest poker face of all time. He won the 1983 World Series of Poker, despite holding only a joker, a Get Out of Jail Free Monopoly card, a 2 of clubs, 7 of spades and a green 4 from UNO.
