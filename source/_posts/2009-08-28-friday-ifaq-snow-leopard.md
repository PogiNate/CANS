Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: Snow Leopard, the coolest cat since the Fonz.

In honor of the [fitfully departed CARS][1], we will be using this space to take calls and answer people’s questions about their new OS.

Q: Hi, I just bought the snow leopard upgrade, but the process seems to be taking a long time.

A: Really? What kind of computer are you trying to install it on?

Q: Computer? What? No, I just took my leopard up north.  He looks cold, sure, but I don’t see his ears shrinking to conserve warmth, and his tail hasn’t become massive and muscular to help him maintain balance on the rocky terrain.  He’s still as clumsy as…. Well there he goes. Right over the edge.

A: Ummmm, your system was faulty to begin with.

Q: I’ll say.

A: Hi, I’m having trouble upgrading to Snow Leopard…

Q: Wait, before you start, you did purchase the Apple Snow Leopard DVD, and you are attempting to install it on a currently running Leopard system, correct?

A: Yeah, I bought the disc, went home and tried to install it on my leopard.

Q: You mean, your Mac running leopard, right?

A: Well, my leopard was always a Linux guy, actually. anyway, I put the disc in and, boy, he’s running now! But he doesn’t seem any more fit for life on the tundra.

Q: You…put the disc… in…

A: Yeah. It didn’t seem to work, though.

Q: How…surprising.

Q: Hi…

A: No! Wait! You are trying to install Snow Leopard on a Macintosh computer, correct?

Q: Yes.

A: And not a big cat of any sort?

Q: No.

A: Okay. what’s your question, then?

Q: How do I get it into my floppy drive?

Q: Hi, I am trying to upgrade OSX 10.5 to OSX 10.6 on an Intel Core 2 Duo iMac using a DVD I purchased today.

A: Wow! Yes! Finally! Okay, so you’re trying to upgrade, and you’re having problems?

Q: No, actually I lied. I finished the upgrade earlier today. It was easy.

A: So…. are you having problems with your new snowy leopardness?

Q: No, no. Everything’s fine. 

A: Have some old PowerPC programs that don’t run any more?

Q: Nope. 

A: So… Why the call?

Q: I’m so lonely! Let’s face it, refinements to an OS do not fill the hole in my life that craves for human contact!

A: Hoo boy.

Q: I’ve not been on a date in years! And nobody reads my blog!

A: Well folks, see ya next time! This could take a while. Enjoy your newly modified big cats!

Q: My mother called me “lasagna brain!” I never had a gerbil! Nobody even says hi to me when I sign in on WoW….
