The Mobile site has all the the flavor and all the footnotes of the full-size site, with none of the archives! That’s right, Mobile CANS lets you live your life by only showing you the last ten posts to the site.  But don’t worry: it considerately stores those articles on your device so even when you’re off line you are on top of the world of new gadgets…and the geeks who love them.

I mean come on, you’ve already clicked the link and you’re using the new site instead of the old one, aren’t you?  Well that’s right friends, all this power, all this lack-of-archive, all this style can be yours absolutely free! Act now! Supplies are limited[3][5]! Operators are standing around.
