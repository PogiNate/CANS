Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we take a look at the new and improved Mail.app as portrayed by Snow Leopard.

Q: I have a lot of email accounts already! What’s a guy gotta do to keep them all organized? I’m lost in a forest of emails, and I need some direction!

A: Have you tried Hare Krishna?[1][1]

Q: Enough with the witty banter already! I swimming in emails! Also, the terminology! POP, IMAP, Exchange, who can keep it all straight I ask you?

A: So you want to be able to handle all your emails in one place?

Q: And the spam! Always with the free offers of medicines, or loans, or the ceaseless pleas for help from princes of distant countries!

A: You didn’t actually fall for any of those, did you?

Q: I answered one or two why not? But all I got was emails with pictures of kittens attached.

A: Yeah, those were “trojan horse” virus emails.

Q: What’s with the talking and the not making any sense? They were kittens I tell you. Kittens!

A: Y-yeah. Anyway, you’re using a Mac, right?

Q: My son set it up for me. He bought me an iMac. I said it was too expensive, that he should keep the nice computer and his mother and I would just use the telephone, but he insisted! he’s a doctor you know. Also, my work uses the Exchange server for their emails, and the Entourage, oh its horrible! Horrible!

A: You’re telling me. Well, fortunately, I have a solution for you. Mail.app can handle all your email accounts in one place, even the work one.

Q: Oh, how I wish I could believe you! How nice it would be to not have to log in to dozens of different sites to read the letters my friends send me from Palm Beach.

A: Your problems are at an end. Mail makes it easy to add all your accounts to one program, and it checks them all for you. Also you can have it sort your mail, so letters from your friends show up in a nice friendly green, while messages from that guy who took your lawnmower in ’68 get sent straight to the trash.

Q: Alright, alright, I’m interested. What’s this going to cost me, all this new technology?

A: Well, no matter what Mac you have, most of it is already there. If you want to be able to sign into your work email, that’s going to cost $30 if you don’t already have Snow Leopard.

Q: Oh, the Snow Leopard! My son, he put that on my iMac last week. He said it would make things faster. I told him that if somebody put a snow leopard in me I would be faster too. But kids these days, what are ya gonna do?

A: Well, then, you’re all set. Now you can set up all your email accounts and thank your son for the help. Send him a nice email.

Q: What’s the use? He never writes back! I mean, would it kill him to write once in a while, Mr. Big Shot Doctor?

A: What kind of doctor is he?

Q: He’s a Mac Doctor!

A: Yeah, I should have expected that.
