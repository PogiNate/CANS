How’s that taste, you Euro-snob?  Where’s your precious Ruby on Rails now?

Q: Is there any reason for me to be involved with this conversation any more?

A:  When others are taking a nap, Bare Bones is doing the Tango of Destiny with the Future, baby!

Q: Worst. Metaphor. Ever.

A: Well, you can go crawling back to your newfangled email clients and your GTD managers. I’m gonna make a **3. Profit!** with my homies at BB. Later, fool!

Q: “Tango of Destiny with the Future?”  Really?
