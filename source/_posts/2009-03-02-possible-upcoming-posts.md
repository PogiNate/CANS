Here at CANS we’re always thinking. Right now we’re thinking, “Hey, Salmon really is pretty tasty!” But we’re also thinking about what we should write on the site. This site.  And now we would like to hear from you[1][1] on some of the topics we’re cooking up.

 [1]: #footnote_0_122 "both of you. All three, if you count j0n"

So, with your comments, let us know which of the following topics you would like to see turned into a full-fledged post this week.  And we’ll see if we can’t pull off more humor and less not-writing than we had last week.

Without further ado, then, I present the list:

*   OSX 10.7 To Be Code-Named “Hobbes”, Bill Watterson Hired to Design Interface
*   Bill Gates Starts New Career as Fireman
*   Zombie Richard Stallman Joins Microsoft Board of Directors
*   John Gruber Makes a Valid Point; Brags About It for Months
*   Zombie Richard Stallman Eats Ballmer; Named CEO of Microsoft in Unanimous Vote
*   That Twitter Bird Icon Named California State Mascot
*   Bill Gates Starts New Career As Astronaut
*   OSX 10.7 To Be Code Named “John Gruber”, He brags about it for years
*   Crazy new stories about upcoming iPhone 3G2.0

What do you think? See something you like? Good stories, these. And I can let you have one for a fraction of normal prices. Act now! Operators are standing on their heads.

1.  both of you. All three, if you count j0n [[↩][2]]
