*Editor’s Note: Our Usual Friday iFAQ this week was somehow replaced with this “Monday FAQ” which comes from SANS, the Sane Apple News Site.  So enjoy what might have been…*

Every Monday we publish a list of Frequently Asked Questions, to help you, the Sane Apple user, get more from your Sane Apple products.

This week: Excel, the best spreadsheet program ever from that underdog software developer, Microsoft.

Q: Why have I never heard of this program?

A: With iWork being the dominant office productivity suite, other office suites often get overlooked.  Microsoft has recently released a new version of their Office suite, and Excel has many features that put it head and shoulders above Numbers.

Q: Microsoft? I thought all they made was Zunes!

A: The popularity of the Zune has led many to believe that.  But they make more than the #1 music player in the world. They even have an operating system, called “Windows” that has gained a bit of traction lately, ever since they turned the code base over to the open source community.

Q: Why would anyone use anything other than OSX?

A: It’s hard to believe, but some people like to go out into the rough and deal with OS’s that crash a lot and get viruses.

Q: What? What’s a virus? Like, using “Windows” will give you a cold?

A: Hahaha, no not quite. They’re not common, but computer viruses[1][1] are small programs that install themselves on a computer and then try to spread to other computers.  Windows is pretty susceptible to these programs, and some people find a thrill in trying to protect their computer from them.

Q: Why don’t they just play tower defense games?

A: It is a mystery.

Q: Anyway, what  was this about a spreadsheet program that’s better than Numbers?

A: Oh, I didn’t say it was better, just taller.  Well, fatter.  Well, it takes up a lot more RAM and hard drive space, and doesn’t really work all that well on Macs.  Microsoft says it works better on Windows, but even Excel can get viruses.

Q: So it’s harder to use, less elegant, wastes space, and RAM?

A: That’s about the size of it, yeah.

Q: That means I can get less work done and blame it on my software!  This is great!  I’ve got to get my whole office to switch over immediately! This non-stop productivity has been driving me crazy! It even cut into my latest surfing trip to Hawaii with my photogenic friends!  Now I can finally stall and procrastinate!  Oh, thank you!

A: Glad to help.
