Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we talk about an oldie but a goodie: Dashboard, the venerable container of small HTML-based applications!

Q: So, is Apple finally ready to confess their sins?

A: Oh, no, not one of you…

Q: Finally ready to admit their rank treachery and thieving ways?

A: Look, what happened happened and there’s very little that can be done about it now, so let it drop, and let’s move on!

Q: Want to keep it quiet, eh? Don’t want the people to know about the far superior experience they could have been having, years before Apple decided that they were taking over the market, huh?

A: Look! I don’t want to be rude, but nobody’s sued anyone, and besides, we’re supposed to be answering questions, not arguing about history.

Q: Alright then, here’s my question: How do you use the Calculator widget?

A: Really?

Q: Really.

A: O-Okay, if that’s your question. The Calculator widget is really pretty straightforward. You click on the numbers and the enter button and math happens.

Q: I mean, “How do you use the Calculator widget knowing full well that Apple stole it lock, stock and barrel from Konfabulator?”

A: Yeah, I kinda thought that’s what you meant. Alright, are we going to do this? Are we going to rehash history and stir up the restless ghosts of old Daring Fireball posts? Fine. Have your say.

Q: Thank you. Ahem. KONFABULATOR WAS AWESOME! IT STILL IS! EVEN AS “[YAHOO WIDGETS][1]” IT’S STILL MORE AWESOME THAN DASHBOARD BECAUSE YOUR WIDGETS CAN BE ON THE SCREEN ALL THE TIME, AND NOT JUST IN THE “DASHBOARD”! IT’S CROSS-PLATORM! IT’S FREE! YOU SHEEP SHOULD USE IT!

A: All better?

Q: *pant pant* Yes. Thank you.

A: Fine. Now, with that out of the way, did you have any questions about the obviously far inferior Apple Dashboard?

Q: Just one.

A: Really? That’s a surprise. So, what’s your question?

Q: Wer ist Ihr Lieblingskäfer?

A: C’mon. Two can play the “ask dumb questions via the Translator widget.” And the answer is Ringo.

Q: Danke.
