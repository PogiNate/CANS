Look, I’ve been publicly hating on John Mayer for a long time, now, and I didn’t get into the “Hate John Mayer” game just to get shown up by some upstart who’s been doing this a lot longer than I have. But what the heck, I like violent mood swings, so I’m happy to welcome[ John Moltz into the Mayer-hating club][1] . We authors of CA*S sites that don’t update all that often have to stick together!

Someday, we can all be free of people who want to “run through the halls of [their] high school” and “break down the double doors.”
