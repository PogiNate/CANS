Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, get more out of your Crazy Apple products. 

This week, it’s all about Twitter’s creatively named Twitter client: Twitter for Mac [#stupidname][1] [#Ilikehashtags][2]

**Q**: So what’s the big deal with Twitter in the first place? Lots of short messages flying around all over the place, forcing people to abbrev

**Q**: Ah, so we’re doing that, are we? all our questions and answers have to be less than 140 characters?

**A**: Yep! It’ll help you stop whinging( on about stupid crap. [#justsayin][3]

**Q**: So the point is to get us all to distill the essence of what we want to say, to refine our thinking and use every letter effectively?

**A**: Well, I think originally it was just because that was the length of a standard text message. [@Pogue][4] would know. He’s like, a Twitter god.

**Q**: 138, 139, 140. Wow, you’re way too good at getting EXACTLY 140 characters in there. Should I be scared?

**A**: Why? It’s just a way to communicate with people, and get a sense of what’s going on in the world around us.

**Q**: Okay, whatever. I’m going to allow–for the moment–that Twitter has validity as a form of communication. But why do I need an app?

**A**: Well, it makes it easier to see what’s happened in your feed, post replies…

**Q**: Easier than going to a web site? That does the exact same thing?

**A**: Well, for one thing, the app wastes far less screen space with stupid things like [#trendingtopics][5]. Seriously, I hate those.

**Q**: And yet you linked to a discussion about them. Odd. 

**A**: Yeah, sorry about that. It gets to be a habit after a while. [#Ijustcannotstopmyself][6]

**Q**: Yeah, I’m still not sold. Not just on the client either. I don’t see a real point for Twitter in general.

**A**: Well, there’s not much I can say to change your mind. It’s all free, so you can try it out, see if you like it. 

**A**: The name is very appropriate: there’s a lot of tweets, like birds in a tree, but they’re all really short and not a big deal. [#nobigdeal][7]

**Q**: Almost thou convincest me to become a…what exactly? Tweeter? Twit? Bird?

A: Yeah, nobody’s really sure. [#ohwell][8].
