Market researchers with too much time on their hands have made an astounding discovery.  
“We have conducted polls of over 2000 people and found that all but one of them agreed that ‘paying less is better than paying more’.

“And that one apparently thought we said ‘We should pay Pauly Shore’ a point of view that is naturally untenable.”

However, the data from this poll seemed doomed to be unproven, until Apple released Snow Leopard. 

“Suddenly we had a real product on which to test our theory,” said the same lab-coat-wearing geeky-looking guy. We never did get his name. “Snow Leopard cost less than Leopard AND gives no money to Pauly Shore! It’s the perfect product! So you can imagine our surprise when Snow Leopard sales have been significantly stronger than Leopard sales.

“We’re talking pants-wetting levels of surprise, folks.”

Steve Ballmer has reportedly been mock-stomping copies of Snlow Leopard in Microsoft all-staff meetings, but this has not had any noticable affect on sales.

Meanwhile, with all major announcements concerning new iPods, tablets, and iPhones either in the past or far in the future, Apple rumor sites have already started speculating on sales figures for OSX 10.7 “Gruber”.

Current estimates on AppleInsider say that 10.7 will sell 40 million copies in the first day. Apple was unwilling to comment, but pointed upward, raised their eyebrows, and nodded significantly.
