As we count the hours until Apple reveals…whatever it is that Apple is going to reveal later this week, we here at CANS have a simple request for the rest of the tech press:

Please stop predicting a new MacBook Air. 

Depending on where you stand on the issue, the MacBook Air is either the best thing Apple’s ever done or is completely obviated by the iPad. Apple either agrees with you or they don’t. Either way, We’re tired of you all talking about it. It’s just not interesting is all. At the end of the day, the Air is just a lil’ ol’ laptop, only it’s not all that much smaller than a MacBook, so it’s just a laptop. 

Since you all seem to be having a hard time thinking up better rumors, we’ve decided to break with our long-standing tradition of only writing about made up factual news to give you a few made up rumors upon which to speculate.

1. The new OS will be the horrible, Lovecraftian hybrid of OSX and iOS, similar in scope of failure to Windows ME, and its release will be a moment of utter rejoicing for Windows fans.  
2. The new OS will be a blend of OSX, Windows, Linux, and iOS that is so amazing that Linus Torvalds starts using it instead of whatever version of Linux he’s using these days. Steve Ballmer is put out to pasture, which will be a moment of utter rejoicing for all people on earth.  
3. Apple will finally release a mid-tower form Mac that has user-upgradeable components other than just the RAM. (I know this one’s so old it’s got whiskers, but we can hope.) Mac users finally start doing well at online games as their graphics capabilities catch up to Windows users.  
4. Apple will announce that they have purchased Adobe, and are turning Flash into an HTML5 framework instead of a plugin-based framework. When asked why, Steve Jobs says that the purchase was made “Mostly just to annoy Android developers. All that work making a flash plugin for their phones and BOOM! We make it completely unnecessary.”  
5. Apple will announce that they have purchased John Gruber and are turning him into a well-rounded tech commentator instead of a rabid tech commentator. When asked why, Steve Jobs says that the purchase was made “Mostly just to annoy David Pogue. All that work put into becoming a really well-rounded tech columnist with an Apple bias and BOOM! We give the nod to someone else.”  
6. In a move that suggests he may have lost his laser-like focus on designing new small electronic devices, Jonathan Ive will spend 20 minutes explaining how he designed the doorknobs for Steve Jobs’ new house.  
7. Home Depot and Lowe’s will be sold out of iKnobs for the next six months solid.

So, there you have it, tech press! Seven jucy, implausible rumors upon which to speculate instead of hoping that the MacBook Air will get thinner by an eighth of an inch.
