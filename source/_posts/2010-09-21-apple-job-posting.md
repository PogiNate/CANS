In this quiet period between the annual music event and the holiday season, Appleâ€™s looking for a way to stay in the headlines, as evidenced by the following job posting:

## Wanted: Philandering Executive 

Candidate must be good at self-promotion and scandal management. Must be able to attract media attention without attaching shame to Apple. Good people skills a must. Please include a mug shot (yours) and a head shot (scandalous partner).
