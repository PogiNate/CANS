*   **11:15pm, Day one – My Hotel Room**: Finish talking with wife on iChat.  Set alarm on cell phone to wake me up at 6:00AM.
*   **3:25 am, Day two – My Hotel Room**: Dream that cats have taken over planet.  All requests for food are must be phrased in the form of “I can has soup?” (really)[1][1]
*   **6:30 am -same place**: wake up and notice that alarm has failed me again.
*   **6:35 am -** stumble into shower. Because bathroom has one light in middle of room and remarkably loud fan, blearily believe that I am being abducted  by aliens so that I can be inducted into Earthling Hall of Fame.  My acceptance speech is hailed as “heart touching…moving” by *Alien Abductors Weekly*.
*   **6:50 am -** decide to stop writing post and go get some breakfast.
*   **7:40 am – CSU:** Resume top-secret meetings with CSU programmers.  They reveal a truth so secret, so, dark, so deep, that Sarah Palin would have me killed if I revealed it here. So I’ll reveal it in the footnotes.[2][2]
*   **11:30 am – CSU:** top-secret meetings concluded, we set off, spirits high and MacBook battery low, back to the Denver Airport.
*   **12:30 – lunch:** Nothing even remotely Apple related happens, except that every other person in the restaurant has an iPhone.
*   **3:30 – Denver Airport:** Flight departs.  Airline stewardess completes safety demonstration, adds under her breath, “hopefully this one makes it over the mountains”[3][3]
*   **3:31 – Denver Airport**: I commence worrying.
*   **4:40 – Salt Lake International Airport:** plane lands.  I have blinked twice, after holding the plane in the air the entire time with nothing but my mind.
*   **5:30 – Salt Lake International Airport:** I finally get my baggage back from the airport trolls. Homeward bound!

And so ends the saga of the Crazy Apple News Fort Collins Trip (CAN… I’m not gonna finish that one.)  I hope you were entertained and enlightened, as I was. True, we never solved the mystery of why CSU doesn’t like Macs, but I did get a number of good meals on somewhat else’s dime.  Thank you.

1.  I never sleep soundly in hotels [[↩][4]]

3.  Not really. She’d probably get fired for saying that. If anyone gets fired and subsequently rich and famous for my little blog, I want it to be *me*. [[↩][6]]
