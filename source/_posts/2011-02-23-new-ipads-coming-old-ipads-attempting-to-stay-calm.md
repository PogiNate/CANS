No, I wasn't invited. Why would I be invited? I'm a nobody, man. 

  
Expect people all over the world to start ditching their iPads in preparation for new iPads, and expect Android tablets to start wondering why they’re not competitive anymore[1][2] .  
Expect Tim Cook to try to be somewhere near as cool as The Steve. Expect a large number of superlatives from Jony Ive about the new device. Expect me to start subtly begging for money so I can buy one of the blasted things.   
And, as always, expect a not-exactly-live post from me covering the event in hard-to-follow detail.
