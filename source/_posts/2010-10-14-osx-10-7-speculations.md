With Apple’s official [announcement ][1]that they *do *remember how to make desktop operating systems the gate has been opened for rampant speculation. We here at CANS have never been above such things, and we see no reason to pretend we are now. Here, then, is our feature list for what looks to be OSX 10.7 “Lion”[1][2] :

*   Apple finally breaks down and puts Blu-Ray into the Mac. Yeah, that’s too crazy even for us.
*   Five, count ‘em *five *new wallpapers!
*   Building on the success of the iOS ecosystem, Apple will limit you to seven screens’ worth of apps on your Mac. “How many word processors do you actually need? Steve Jobs will explain.[2][3]
*   Apple will announce a new MacBook Air. It will have a touch screen and a detachable keyboard. Critics who point out that it looks a lot like an iPad and keyboard set bundled into one box will never be heard from again.
*   Lion will have a new 3D interface that utilizes a living room motif. The Sign-in screen will be the front door, your office apps would be on a desk, your games on a shelf, your movies in an entertainment center, etc. It’ll be high-tech and awesome and everyone will love it. Critics who point out that it’s just an updated version of [Microsoft Bob][4] will never be heard from again.
*   Apple will stop supporting Adobe Flash on the desktop. “Oh, we have the technology,” Jony Ive will say. “We just like to tweak Adobe every now and again. Besides, who even needs Flash, now that[ Homestar Runner][5] isn’t updating any more?”
