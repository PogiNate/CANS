Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and  
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy  
Apple products.

In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.

This week we start with the most popular and used member of the suite: iWeb.

Q: Is iWeb hard to use?

A: Like all iLife products, iWeb is a simple solution that allows anyone to publish their life to the Web. You can publish blogs, movies, photo galleries and more, all without writing a single line of code.

Q: What if I want to write my own code?

A: Please, not to make us laugh. You. Want to write. Your own code. Go ahead on there, Mr. Webmaster. I’m sure your site will look WAAAY better than the themes that Apple paid thousands and thousands of dollars to have developed. Yep, have fun with those  tags!

Q: So I should just stick to the pre-defined themes?

A: That would be best.

Q: Apple paid thousands of dollars to have someone develop a black screen with a reflection under any picture?

A: You try making that reflection! It’s really hard!

Q: Uh huh.

A: Did you have any other questions, or just snide remarks?

Q: Right, sorry. Okay, next question: I don’t have a Mobile Me account–

A: WHAT? Why not!?!

Q: Whoa, easy there, mister punctuation!

A: Why don’t you have a Mobile Me account!?

Q: Hey! I’m the “Question” guy! Stop asking me questions! I don’t have a Mobile Me account because I don’t want to pay $100 a year for web hosting. And my question is: Can I host an iWeb site on something other than Mobile Me?

A: No.

Q: Really?

A: I don’t know if I should even be talking to you, you heretic.

Q: C’mon, don’t be like that. Give us a little smile!

A: No, stop it \*sigh\* oohhh, you know I can’t stay mad at you. But I don’t know if I should answer your little question.

Q: Hey, be a pal. I’ll be your best friend!

A: All right, all right. Yes, you can host an iWeb site on any web host using a program like Panic’s [Transmit][1] to upload the files. There. Are you happy now?

Q: Yep! Thanks!

A: Fine. Anything else?

Q: Yes. STOP ASKING QUESTIONS! I’m the guy with the “Q” in front of my lines!

A: Sorry.

Q: That’s better.
