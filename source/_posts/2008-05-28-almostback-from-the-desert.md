I’m somewhere between Moab and home, and this is all I have time to put up. I hope the androids have been good. I don’t think I’ll ever get the red dirt back out of my hair. Talk amongst yourselves. Er, yourself. I’ll give you a topic: [Zion National Park][1] is neither in Zion nor is there any parking. Discuss.
