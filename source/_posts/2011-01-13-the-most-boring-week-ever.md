Yeah, I realize it’s been almost an entire week since we’ve posted anything, but seriously, can you think of any Apple-type news that’s happened this week? It’s been pretty dang quiet is all I’m saying.

I mean, most weeks you can rely on Google to do something incendiary, or at least there’ll be some iPhone news, although calling anything short of new hardware “news” is kinda blowing things out of proportion. I mean, if the iPhone were to, say, get an all new antenna design so it could work with different carriers and solve the hideous “death grip” problem, that’d be something, but “oh look, there’s a new app!” just doesn’t cut it.

But here’s the thing that really gets our goat: If, say, Dave Barry were to write this article he would get thousands of letters explaining to him that there have been big Apple-centric news stories this week, and what was he thinking writing something like this. But my audience is all full of smart people who actually understand sarcasm and whatnot, so I don’t get the free follow-up article. I’ll tell you this, though: I’m not covering any more iPhone stories until they bring the blasted thing to T-Mobile. In the US, not in Germany, where T-Mobile’s had the iPhone forever. And even then, I’d probably still spend more time being annoyed by Google’s decision to contribute to browser fragmentation. Put all that to one side, and this article will be really unbalanced, because other than that, I’ve really got nothing this week.

Well, except for whatever tomorrow’s iFAQ will be about[1][1]

Okay then. As you were. Carry on.
