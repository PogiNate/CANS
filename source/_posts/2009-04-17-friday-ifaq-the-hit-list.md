Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: The Hit List: Yet Another To-do List Program (YATDLP)

Q: Do we really need YATDLP?

A: Have you done everything you need to do?

Q: Of course not!

A: Are you putting things in contexts, basing your allocation of time on your roles and goals, and continually sharpening the saw?

Q: You’re mixing productivity paradigms, I think…

A: So what, now you’re saying it’s Covey or Allen, not both?  Because you’ve got it all figured out, I guess.  Well, I should just phone up Merlin Mann right now and tell him I’ve finally met the person who’s got it all together!  Won’t he be excited!

Q:  I didn’t say I have it all together! I just don’t see why I can’t use [Todoist][1], [Task Paper][2], [Things][3], [Remember the Milk][4] or any of the other programs that are designed to keep me on task and doing what I’m supposed to be doing. Why do I need another one? What makes this one better?

A: Oh, so you don’t need new features? You think that AppleScript is passé, and you have absolutely no need to measure how long you’ve spent on a task. You’re just too good for that sort of thing, I suppose?

Q: I’m not saying that The Hit List doesn’t have good features, I’m just wondering where the trade-off is.

A: Or maybe you don’t need to sync with iCal… What trade-off?

Q: At what point do we start losing productivity to learning and re-learning our productivity software?

A: Wait, you…you mean, just *stick* with a system?

Q: Well, it was a thought…

A: So, just pick a product, get to know it, and just…*use* it?

Q: I wasn’t saying you couldn’t *look* at other software, I just thought…

A: I don’t think you’re serious about your productivity.

Q: Oh, I’m serious! I want to be more productive in the trendiest way possible, just like the rest of the productivity pack!

A: I should take away your moleskine journal and stack of index cards for even suggesting that the path to efficacy is so…so *mundane*.

Q: No! not my index cards!

A: Personal productivity is a quest, not a destination! You can’t just claim that you’ve suddenly *found* a program that works for you and just *use* it!

Q: No, of course not! You’re right! I’ve got to keep looking for better ways to do more, focus on the most important things, get things done, make friends, influence people…

A: That’s right. Keep those mantras flowing.

Q: …Move the cheese, melt the iceberg, praise Allen, Blanchard, and Mann, Hallelujah.

A: Hallelujah, brother.  Now go, use The Hit List in peace, compare it to other programs, and write blog posts weighing its merits and weaknesses.

Q: I will.

A: Good. We won’t speak of this again.
