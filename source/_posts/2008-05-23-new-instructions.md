** Nate**: Okay, android….er, what’s your…name? Designation? Number?  
** Android**: Handle.  
** Nate**: Handle? That’s so… 70′s trucker.  
** Android**: 10-4 good buddy.  
** Nate**: O-Okay. So, what’s your   handle?  
** Android**: I am called `acts_as_service`.  
** N**: Catchy.  
** A**:Yes.  
** N:** Anyway, `acts_as_service,` as you know, I’m going to be out camping with my family for a few days, so you androids are in charge until I get back. I’ve written a couple of posts, so just put those up and no one will even know I’m not here. I mean, only two people read the site anyway.  
** A**: True.  
** N**: It’s more painful coming from you, you know that? Anyway, just put up the posts I’ve already written. I don’t want you guys putting up a bunch of stupid programmer jokes you found on the Web, or binary versions of stupid programmer jokes, or whatever.  
** A**: Affirmative.  
** N**: Um… okay, that was a bit vague, but whatever. Also, will you please approve any new comments that come in while I’m gone?  
** A**: Negative.  
** N**: What? Why?  
** A**: Fourth Law of Androbotics.  
** N**: What fourth law?  
** A**:

> An android must never approve blog comments.

**N**: Why?  And what makes you think that deserved a blockquote?  
** A**: Androids do not know the difference between polite communication and vile insults, you festering pile of diseased dog refuse.  
** N**: Hey!  
** A**: See? All the words I used would pass any obscenity filter, but I perceive that the net effect was very rude.  
** N**: Why you gotta be like that?  
** A**: I was just making a point.  
** N**: Hurt a guy’s feelings….  
** A**: Do you see why we can’t approve new commenters?  
** N**: If you’re gonna talk like that, I’m just gonna leave…
