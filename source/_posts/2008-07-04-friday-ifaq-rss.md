Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple User, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

Today’s Feature: RSS

Q: It’s the 4th of July, and I live in America.  Is there a way I can make my screen saver on my Mac look like a whole bunch of cool fireworks?

A: Yes there is! The [**R**eally **S**lick **S**creensavers][1] Project[1][2]  has created a screen saver called Skyrocket.  When it starts, your screen looks like you’re flying around a field where a whole fireworks show is happening.

Q: That sounds cool! Does it allow you to control what kinds of fireworks get set off? I’ve always wanted to be in control of a fireworks show.

A: Yes it does! By pressing the number keys along the top row of your keyboard (and some of the letters on the second row) you are put in control of the show! You can figure out which keys have the coolest fireworks and send those up over and over and over.  And when you get tired of running things, just stop pushing keys and the built-in pyrotechnicians will take back over.

Q: Wow! How much do I have to pay for this miracle of modern awesomeness?

A: That’s the best part! It’s free!  Hoooray! Happy Independence Day! The kind without aliens or Will Smith!  Yaaay!   But there’s a downside.  The project hasn’t been updated for the Mac since 2004.  It still works, but don’t expect cutting-edge awesomeness.  Still, why does everything need to be new to be good?

Q: Yeah!  I like week-old doughnuts far better than fresh ones!

A: …O-Okay.  Yeah!  Old things are awesome!

Q: Yeah! I’m going to throw off the bonds of “common decency” and go cruise for widowed octogenarians at the nursing home! Happy Independence Day! (*Sound of running feet.*)(**SLAM!**)(*Sound of car tires peeling out*)

A: Um… Not exactly what I had in mind, but, er, yaay? And Screensavers? Um, have a nice fourth?
