Martyn Williams, who surely had better things to do, chose instead to write about the [downfall of tr.im][1], a nearly unknown url shortener, who sought to compete with the equally stupid sounding [bit.ly][2], [tinyurl.com][3], and the almost-longer-than-the-original [readthisurl.com][4]. And we here at CANS are glad he did, as we were all set to launch into the beta testing phase of our own url shortening website.  We had already run into a few snags with our program, not the least of which was the fact that our “shortened” urls were promising to look something like “http://crazyapplenews.com/shortening/index.php/sle4231xfSEslkeyggiotr78Cvdew” [1][5]

We will now observe a minute of silence for the fallen tr.im, shortened to three seconds, as they would have wanted it.  

Thank you.
