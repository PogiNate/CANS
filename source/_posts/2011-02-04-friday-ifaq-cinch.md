Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products. 

Today we throw some fuel on the eternal flamewar and review Cinch, the program that Apple should have thought of first.

Q: So, I have a problem. It’s, well, it’s all my windows.

A: Go on.

Q: They’re not bad, you understand. That is, they mean well, you see. 

A: I understand.

Q: But, well, they’re a bit unruly from time to time.

A: They start sitting on top of each other, that sort of thing?

Q: Exactly. Like, XCode will lean just enough to cover a column of text in my browser window, or Chrome will be just big enough to Obscure iTunes’ controls, that sort of thing.

A: So, it’s not enough for you to actually get mad, at them, because they’re not actually doing anything wrong, but they’re definitely acting up a bit.

Q: Yeah. I’ve tried putting them in different [Spaces][1], you know, so that Chrome is in 1 and XCode is in 2, and that keeps them from touching each other, but it gets to be a real pain running back and forth all the time, know what I mean?

A: Some days it feels like that’s all you do, running back and forth from one program to the next, each one bouncing their icon at you, trying to get your attention.

Q: You’ve seen this sort of behavior before, I see.

A: I’ve got programs too, my friend. I understand what you’re going through.

Q: Well, what’s worked for you? How do you keep your programs in line? I mean, it seems like this is a pretty common problem.

A: There’s a great new app in the Mac App Store that takes care of just this problem. It’s called [Cinch][2], and it’s exactly what you need.

Q: How does it work?

A: With Cinch installed, you just drag a window’s title bar to the edge of the screen to make that window take up exactly one half of your display. Drag a window to the other side and you’ve got two nicely lined-up windows, not touching each other, just sharing an edge.

Q: So I can look at things in Chrome while I work in XCode!

A: Exactly my friend.

Q: That’s a seriously great idea! Why hasn’t anyone made this [part of their operating system][3] yet?

A: It’s a mystery. One more thing, by the way. Let’s say you want one app to take full screen. All you do is drag it’s title bar up to the top of the screen and BAM! Full screen mode.

Q: That’s great. But what if I want to put everything back where it was?

A: Just drag the windows back to the middle of the screen and they’ll resize back to what they looked like before you Cinched them up.

Q: That is some seriously intuitive and useful user interface work. What kind of genius [came up with that][3], I wonder?

A: We may never know.
