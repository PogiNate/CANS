Welcome to another episode of fireside chats. Today we look at two up and coming descendants of the monster that was WebTV set-top compu-media devices: Apple’s Apple TV and Google’s Google TV.[1][1]

Welcome to you both.

Apple TV: It’s nice to be here.

Google TV: Where exactly is “here”? How did we get to a featureless gray void?

Moderator: For simplicity, I’m going to just call you Apple and Google, is that acceptable?

A: Certainly.

G: I mean, that gradient from below us to above us is nice, but what are we even standing on?

M: First question is for both of you. There’s some confusion over what value you bring to the living room experience. Where do you fit in to the modern entertainment center?

A: I think that set-top connectivity boxes like Google and me are meant to be a gateway to the increasingly massive amount of quality entertainment on the internet. When you buy a HD movie on iTunes you want to be able to watch it on your 50″ television, instead of your 13″ MacBook. I let you do just that.

G: While I agree at first, I find that I eventually have to steal Apple’s good ideas and get fired from his board of directors. But I kid. No, Apple TV has it basically correct. We bring the richness of the internet to the living room. There’s a lot more out there to watch than just YouTube, and even YouTube is better on the big screen.

M: Apple, what sets you apart from the competition?

A: Well, it’s the experience, isn’t it? Set me down, plug me in, and you’re off and running. There’s no learning curve; you already know how my interface works. You have instant access to all your photos, music, and movies on all your computers, and you can rent movies and TV shows instantly from the couch. 

M: Google, same question.

G: What sets me apart is freedom, baby. I can do it all. search, watch TV on a number of websites, Netflix–

A: I can do Netflix!

G: Amazon Unbox, 

A: I can…watch movies from iTunes.

M: Apple, please.

G: Anyway, you can get your content from anywhere. Websites will be able to create TV-specific views of their pages, and you’ll be able to see them on Google TV. Pretty soon you’ll be able to install apps on me as well.

A: I might get apps some day.

M: Apple, you seem a bit defensive about some of Google’s claims. Why is that?

A: Well, it’s nothing really. I think Google’s a little to focused on feature lists is all.

M: And that’s a problem?

A: Well, I prefer to focus on the overall experience.

G: Without getting too much into that, I feel the experience is enhanced by more data streams and more choices.

M: And you have both given our viewers something to think about, in terms of choice. One last question. Who do you think will win?

G: Nobody.

A: No one.

M: I’m sorry?

A: Look, what are we, really? Let’s be honest, this is just WebTV 3.0. People keep trying this little experiment, and it keeps tanking. Why would that change now?

G: He’s got a point. If you want a computer, go to your computer. You wanna watch a movie? just watch a movie.

A: If anyone is going to win, it’s my big brother, Mac Mini.

G: Oh, no doubt. That guy’s got it all over us. He can do anything either one of us can do, and he’s a real computer as well.

A: My existence is kind of embarrassing, when he’s around.

G: My existence is still kind of tenuous at best.

M: Well, this has been a thorough waste of our time then. Until next time, I’m your nameless Moderator, and this has been Fireside Chats. Goodnight.
