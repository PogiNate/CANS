It has come to my attention that, in my haste to publish the earnings of this blog, I failed to mention one line item. It is with the intent to rectify this oversight that I do hereby publish the following:

*   **Over 200 comments apiece from two very faithful commenters, valued at**: giving me a reason to keep doing this. 
    *   **Personal value**: priceless.[1][1]

To the other roughly 20 people a day who read this blog: would it kill you to write once in a while? Your mother and I, we worry about you, out there all alone while people like Kanye West and John Meyer are on the loose.

1.  note to the IRS: taxable value is still zero! [[â†©][2]]
