This week we seek for some solace in nostalgia with the advent of [Bowtie][2], a skinnable iTunes controller.

Q: A What-able what now? What is the madness you are saying with your face?

A: Oh, come on, we were all there. Remember the early 2000’s when you were finally able to play music on your computer, and you had all these cool skins for your music player?

Q: No.

A: Sure you do. You could make it look like a brain, and the buttons were made out of wrinkles on the brain’s surface, or you could have it look like a big piano with the control buttons outlined on the keys, or whatever.

Q: Nope! 

A: Wow, did you miss out. All the music players did it. Windows Media Player, Winamp, RealPlayer…

Q: All windows programs you’ll notice.

A: Er, well, see, I didn’t get my first mac until 2006, so…

Q: Well, for those of us who have always used good computers we’ve used boring, gray old iTunes and liked it. We don’t need your silly skinnable thingies.

A: But look, you’ve got a chance now! Bowtie is free in the Mac App Store, and you can have a little player that shows you what album you’re listening to, has all your controls, and is really really out of the way AND cool looking, all at the same time!

Q: I don’t really see the point…

A: AND it lets you love or ban songs on Last.fm, so people know what you think about the music you’re listening to! That’s something we couldn’t do back in the day, back with dumb ol’ web 1.0

Q: So there really isn’t a point.

A: The point is to have fun! Come on, it’s spring! The sky is bright, life is good, maybe you should loosen up a bit too! Sometimes things can just be fun. I’m using it to listen to the Tron: Legacy soundtrack right now, just because I can! 

Q: Hmmm, not sure I can lower my standards of “fun” quite that far.

A: \*sigh\*. Okay, Mr. Boring Pants. Go watch your news programs and listen to your collection of the 100 greatest renditions of *4'.33"* I’ll catch you later.

Q: What’s wrong with *[4'33"][3]*?

A: Oh, it’s nothing.[1][4]
