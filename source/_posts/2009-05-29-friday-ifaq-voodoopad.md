Q: I want to make up news stories!

A: Whaaa! Easy there, pardner. What the heck?

Q: But Wikipedia has banned me!

A: Ah, I see now.

Q: Can the Flying Meat give me amazing Voodoo powers?

A: No. They can give you an amazing personal wiki.

Q: Where I can make up news stories?

A: I usually use a blog to do that. For that matter, so does C|Net.

Q: But I’ll have my own wiki, right? Just like Wikipedia?

A: Weeeeeeell, you’ll have  a wiki, but it’s personal, see? So it’s like, only on your computer. Not out on the web.[1][2]

Q: But I can make up news, right?

A: Easy there, Citizen Kane. Yes, I suppose you could.

A: Ummm…

Q: Or should I just keep waitin’ on the world…

A: HEY! Stop that! As long as you ask questions under my roof  there will be no John Mayer song titles!

Q: Okay, I’ll try again.

A: Okay.

Q: Ahem. Okay, here goes. “Or should I just remember when I ruled the world”?

A: Convoluted, but better. Anyway, it’s a personal wiki. It’s to help you keep track of your thoughts.  As the makers say, “you put your brain in it.”

Q: Okay! Done.  Now what?

A: Ummm, you use it to find things you were thinking about, and, umm… use that knowledge to move forward in your life?

Q: All I found was an awesome way to finally be better than Batman.

A: Okay, we’re done here. You should go read [Dinosaur Comics][3], you’ve got a soulmate there. I’m gonna go do that voodoo that I do so well.
