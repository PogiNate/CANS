Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: Terminal

Q: D00d, ru a 1337 HAXX0R?

A: No, I speak *English*. Not idiot.

Q:Whatev, man. I’m a total hacker.  I could hack your Mac right now, and you wouldn’t even know it.

A: Uh-huh. Did you have a question of some sort?

Q: Why do you use that Mac, man? My box is a dual-booted Windows XP and Ubuntu system, and in Ubuntu I can *rule the world* from the command line.

A: Nnnnnno, you can’t.  I use the Mac because it’s simple, clean, stable, and friendly to developers and bloggers alike.  Did you have any other questions?

Q: You don’t even have a command line, dude. You’re all “I gotta click on a picture or it’s not a real program.” I could P0wn you so hard. Just tell me your IP address and your Mac is my *slave*.

A: Not a question. But actually, there is a command line interface for OSX. It’s called Terminal.  It lets me do all the Unixy things that the Mac is so good at, just like your little Ubuntu box.  And my IP address is [127.0.0.1][1]. Hack away!

Q: Yeah right. I’m not a total newb.  I know that one.

A: You’ve done it before, haven’t you?

Q: Shut up!

A: You totally did, didn’t you?  You were all, “I’m gonna hack this dude’s system, look, I totally have root access #rm -rf /  oh noes, where are all my files?”

Q: I did not! I just… I just wanted to try a new distro. At three in the morning!

A: Yep. Look, you already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Why not get yourself [a little something][2]?  I think we’ll all be happier.

Q: I can’t, my allowance is cut off ever since my mom saw what I was doing on her computer…

A: Let her know that the Mac has *real* parental controls, she’ll get you one.  Bye bye, script kiddie!

*Note: The editor–who works as an IT person for a living and is tired of script kiddies attacking the systems for which he is responsible–needed to blow off some steam.  I promise more insightful, less vitriolic posts next week.  Maybe even tomorrow; maybe even with footnotes, we’ll see. And remember: Friends don’t let friends speak Leet.*
