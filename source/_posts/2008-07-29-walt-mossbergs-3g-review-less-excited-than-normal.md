With the release of the iPhone 3G, we were excited to read Walt Mossberg’s review of the new and improved hardware and software offerings from Apple. As he has with so many other new releases, Walt praised the iPhone in general and the App Store specifically, but we wanted more.  
I mean, look at his [review of Firefox 3][1]:  
> Firefox 3.0 is the best Web browser out there right now, and that it tops the current versions of both IE and Safari in features, speed and security.
Or how about his review of [the App store][2]:  
> compared with the graphically rich, snappy iPhone apps — many of which fetch data from the Internet at high speed — the typical program on these older platforms [Palm and Blackberrry] looks positively primitive.
But his latest review of the iPhone itself, well, it was…  
it was kinda *negative*. And we just can’t handle that.

I mean sure, he calls it “a true computing platform with wide versatility” and “the world’s most influential smart phone”. But he also complains about the battery life, talks about it having problems with syncing email from Exchange and other systems, and he says that it’s more expensive due to AT&T’s increased prices. 

How do you think that makes Apple feel, Walt? You can’t blame Apple for some battery supplier’s problems, or Microsoft’s terrible Exchange system, or AT&T’s pricing schemes. These things aren’t Apple’s fault! 

And what about us, the consumers? What we want from you is happy –nay, ebullient– reviews of new products so we can feel good about spending all our money on things we don’t need and keep the economy from going in the toilet. And you give us objectivity. Great. Thanks. We can get that from bankers or lawyers. 

So fine, you don’t absolutely love the iPhone 3G. Great. I guess we can deal with that, Mr. Mossberg. Just don’t say anything nasty about our good, beloved, almost-working [Mobile Me][3]…  
Oh, you *rat*.
