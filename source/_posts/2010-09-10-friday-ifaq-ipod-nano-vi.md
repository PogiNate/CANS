Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we tackle Apple’s latest iPoddish offerings mano-a-nano.

Q: **What happened to my video camera?**

A: Easy there. We don’t abuse  tags around here like that, sonny.

Q: So now I have to pony up for an iPad Junior[1][1] to take full-motion video of my dog chasing his tail and running into a wall.

 [1]: #footnote_0_941 "Why are we even calling the Touch an iPod any more?"

A: Wait, how often do you take that video?

Q: About once a week.

A: Now THAT is a dumb dog.

Q: He once attacked a leaf on the driveway.

A: Dogs do that all the time–

Q: And lost.

A: Wow. Now that’s impressive.

Q: You’d think so, but you’d be wrong. But the point is the nano, which was becoming a more and more respectable device with every iteration, has now become some sort of twisted, Lovecraftian demon spawn–

A: I’m gonna have to interrupt you there. You’re comparing this:[![iPod Nano 6th Generation][3]][3]

Q: Well, okay, it’s not all that bad, I guess. But still, all my favorite features! Gone!

A: Your camera.

Q: Well yeah.

A: Because all the other features are there.

Q: What? No they aren’t.

A: I mean, FM Radio, Nike , Genius, it’s all there.

Q: No notes, no images, no movies, they’re all gone.

A: So what do you want to do? Cry? Buy a Zune? Maybe a [Zen][4]?

Q: Don’t be crass.

A: So, what’s your point?

Q: I just want…

A: Go ahead.

Q: I just want… I want Apple to love me.

A: There now, was that so hard?

Q: I mean, with all the attention they’ve been paying to the iPad and the iPhone, it feels like they don’t even care about those of us who use OSX and iPod OS anymore.

A: It can be hard to move on. But you’ve got to see the bright future beyond the current clouds.

Q: I don’t want to move on! I want everything to be the way it was before!

A: I know honey. But it will be okay, I promise. Listen, let me buy you a song on iTunes, like the old days. Will that help you feel better?

Q: That would…well, it would help.

A: Okay. Let’s go. But no more 90′s rap, okay? Pick something nice this time.

Q: I’ll try.
