Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and  
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy  
Apple products.

In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each  
week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we  
will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.

This Week: that greatest of all “jukebox” programs, a great app and a close personal friend, please give a warm, Crazy Apple News Site round of applause to: iTunes![1][1]

 [1]: #footnote_0_104 " Yes, iTunes is technically part of iLife.  Even though it’s  a free download and runs on Windows."

Q: How can I copy music off of my friend’s iPod into my iTunes library?

A: Erm, I don’t think I should be telling you [how to do things][2] that are against your agreement with Apple.

Q: Jerk.

A: Boogerhead.

Q: Dorkface.

A: …But enough of this witty repartee. Do you have any *legal* questions about iTunes?

Q: Fine.  Okay, here’s one for you.  In Windows Media Player I can just drag songs I want to listen to into the “Now Playing” bar and they queue up and play in order.  Why can’t I do something like that in iTunes?

A: You can add them to the party shuffle playlist and they will be played in the order you supply.

Q: Yes, and after the  sweet, haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata fade quietly into the darkness and you are considering the majesty of creation and Man’s place in it you suddenly get “Baby Got Back”, because Party Shuffle is about as intelligent and sensitive as a dragon in a store that sells wedding dresses.

A: Why do you even *have* “Baby Got Back” in your iTunes library?

Q: What? That’s not the point. And you completely ignored my witty allegory.

A: It was a simile. What else do you have in there? “Bust a Move”, by Young MC? Maybe some Kriss Kross? How about Marky Mark’s #1 Jam “Good Vibrations”?

Q: What’s wrong with you?

A: I’m just trying to figure out why you are still listening to novelty rap from the early-to-mid nineties.

Q: Look, I don’t have all of M.C. Hammer’s albums tucked away in my iPod, alright? It was just an example, and  you are still totally ignoring my question…

A: I’ll bet you *do* have a complete M.C. Hammer collection! I’ll bet you even have the oft-overlooked, but actually quite excellent “Let’s Get it Started” album!

Q: …And you are the one that seems to know all about the novelty rap songs.  How’s that C C Music Factory tape holding up after all these years?  Thought about making the jump to CD any time soon?

A: Oh, I bought that one on CD back– hey!

Q: Thought so.

A: Whatever. Jus’ shut up.

Q: Well, I’m not getting any useful answers out of you when you’re in this mood, so I’ll leave you to your VHS copies of Yo! MTV Raps!.

A: At least I don’t make playlists with “Moonlight Sonata” and “Baby Got Back” in them. Say “hi” to the New Kids on the Block for me. Geek.

Q: Poser.

A: Nerd….

*(They continue as we fade to silence)*[2][3]
