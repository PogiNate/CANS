You may have been wondering what happened to me over the past two weeks that nothing has been posted. Yes, an occasional twitter update, but not much beyond that. And it would be totally in keeping with this site’s mandate to assert that I had been left in a bar by an Apple engineer who’d had one too many German beers. Or I could say I was too German for Apple, and thus left in an iPhone by a Barrister. It would not be stretching my credibility too far to even suggest that I was barred from Germans by two left Apple beers.

I could also go on a long rant about [Gizmodo ][1]being a bunch of money-grubbing lowlifes, and strongly avow a desire to see them get hung out to dry in court. But I’m not going to do that either. Truth is, I think Gizmodo is a great site and sincerely hope that they continue to make millions of dollars, and then use those millions to get [absurdly low prices][2] on ill-gotten hardware prototypes. Also, good luck to Brian Lam and Jason Chen when they try to get into the next event at Moscone West![1][3]

Or I could wax lyrical about my iPad and the way it has filled a niche in my life, changed how I work and play, and made me a better and more well rounded person. I could discuss the amazing touch screen, the simple beauty of the Numbers app, which I have been using the heck out of; or fondly discuss the time I’ve spent reading in iBooks and the awesomeness of being able to touch a word and instantly access it’s definition in a dictionary, or look it up in the book and on Wikipedia. I could get misty-eyed relating the joy of streaming MST3K via Netflix to my couch in the middle of the night.

But I’m not going to do that. The reality is that I have been involved in Very Serious Things of a Positive Nature that have taken Considerable Time[2][4]. As you can tell, I’ve also been putting in some time with Winnie-the -Pooh on the iPad with my kids.

But that sort of thing does not good blogging make. So instead I’ll offer to make it up to you with not one but two iFAQ’s this week, as well as an investigative report the likes of which we haven’t featured since the early days of CANS. Stay tuned to this channel!
