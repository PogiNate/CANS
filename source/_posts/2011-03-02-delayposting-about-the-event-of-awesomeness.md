**10:00- **Steve is on stage! But not made of metal, which is disappointing.

**10:05-** iPads are selling like really expensive hotcakes. Everyone loves them.

**10:15- **Doctors can show you your x-rays without you getting out of bed with their iPad. “This is where we think I left my watch,” says Dr. Johnson.

**10:16- **Kids love iPads too! Who knew?

**10:17- **The iPad…loves you. It loves children. It’s basically an angel of love and light and love.

**10:18-** iPad 2 gets announced today. Say goodbye to the copycats.

**10:19- **New Processor! Faster! Dual core! Did we mention faster? It’s faster. That’s why it’s called “A5”.

**10:20-** Cameras! Gyroscopes! Miracles!

**10:21- **It’s thinner too. Faster! Thinner! Cameras!

**10:22- **White iPad. ugly.

**10:23- **Verision and AT&T. I have nothing to say about that.

**10:24- **The white one is still really ugly.

**10:25- **The prices, they no move. No come down, but no go up. So there you go.

**10:25- **They ship on March 11th. Take that, all you other tablets that haven’t shipped yet.

**10:27- **For $40 you can have a weird port splitter thing. Charge and use all at once! You know you want it.

**10:30- **Weird new magno-roll-up cover thingy. Looks…cool? if you like the color light blue.

**10:31- **A RAINBOW of colors! A rainbow that includes three shades of what amounts to “black or gray” And executive leather covers. For the discerning user.

**10:32-** Scott Forestall is out, and is feeling intense about iOS 4.3

**10:35- **iPad switch does what YOU want, baby. It’s your switch. As long as you want it to mute or lock rotation.

**10:36- **iPhone 4 is now a hotspot.

**10:37- **Photobooth demos. I’m still not over the original OSX photobooth demos. Please stop.

**10:39-** FaceTime. Yep. Yep.

**10:41- **Big stuff coming out on March 11th.

**10:42- **iMovie for iPad. All the Pixar engineers who have been working with iMovie for iPhone breathe a sigh of relief. Finally! a slightly larger screen!

**10:44-** iMovie for iPad is…a lot like the OSX version. But it’s got a cool marquee thing on the home screen, so that’s cool, right?

**10:48-** My limited patience for iMovie demos is coming to an end. Seriously, guys. Move on.

**10:49- **Steve just revealed how old he is “It blows my mind, this stuff.” He may have well added “What with the tapping and the rotating and the looking and the making movies? I don’t know.”

**10:50- **GarageBand for iPad. This one make sense. But still, the demo better be short.

**10:52- **Moving on. Okay, thanks for the GarageBand demo. Moving on now. Please?

**10:53-** “This is a window into a much larger piano”. I’m pretty sure that’s not how that works.

**10:55- **Apparently the rest of the demo is all GarageBand, all the time.

**10:56- **Drums. DO NOT USE DRUMSTICKS! Use your fingers. Or our new iSticks.

**10:57-** Smart guitar: the guitar is smart, so you don’t have to be.

**11:00- **Okay, I’m going to just be over there somewhere until they’re done talking about GarageBand. Talk amongst yourselves.

**11:03- **Garage band is finally done. That was painful.

**11:05- **“Now we made a video that I’d love to show you.” Did they make it in iMovie on an iPad 2?

**11:06- **Jony Ive likes the iPad 2 A. LOT.

**11:09-** Kinda bummed they didn’t make iWeb for the iPad.

**11:11- **Steve is on stage, wrapping things up…hopefully. Unless he’s got some cool news about something else.

**11:12- **Steve is giving a speech about DNA and technology and stuff. It sounds kinda mystical.

**11:13- **And that’s all folks! Thanks for joining us in joining others…or something. And remember, if you enjoyed this post, why not buy your editor an iPad 2? It’s the classy thing to do.
