So, I posted a stupid comment on an article by Roger Ebert on my [other blog][1], figuring that no one would read it, because no one ever does. Apparently Ebert did, and posted a link on Twitter, and now Iâ€™m fielding about 10 hate comments an hour. Moral of the story: if you are going to post poorly thought out vile slanders of famous people make sure you do it on a humor blog. Better moral of the story: post well thought out vile slanders instead.
