Join us once again for Fireside Chats, where we bring two points of view together and hope they start hitting each other with chairs, Jerry Springer style. And if ever there was a pairing less likely to do that than our two current guests, we’ve never heard of it.

Today we have iOS, the up-and-coming jack-of-all-devices operating system, and OSX, the elegant master of big computers.  
Moderator: Gentlesystems, welcome.

**iOS**: It’s good to be here.

**OSX**: Always a pleasure.

**Moderator**: iOS, you’ve become one of the largest, if not the largest, mobile operating systems in the world in just a few years. OSX, despite your acknowledged superiority, you still struggle to reach 10% of the desktop market. Why do you think that is?

**iOS**: I have built on the foundation laid by my honorable parent, OSX, and expanded into a new area, an area which before now didn’t really exist.

**OSX**: I do not hold onto the mistakes of the past that limited my size. Does the gnarled pine curse the rock that forced its seedling into its current shape? Or does it not, instead, seek to turn this obstacle into a chance for greater, more unexpected beauty? Long have I envisioned the day where I might burst forth triumphant, although now I see that this victory may come through my offspring.

**iOS**: I am humbled and honored.

**Moderator**: So, OSX, not to tread on this tender moment, but it kinda sounds like you’re giving up there. 

**OSX**: The battle may still be won, but the field is no longer central to the war. Still, we put up the good fight, and expect success on this front.

**Moderator**: iOS, what about you? How do you see your battle going?

**iOS**: While it is unwise to try to predict the movements of one’s opponents, I am sanguine in my hopes for victory. the iPad is unrivaled, and no real rivals are seen on the horizon. the iPhone gains in popularity day by day, hardware mistakes notwithstanding. and the iPod Touch, as well, is in a class by itself.

**Moderator**: That’s true. Despite the continued offerings of Creative and Microsoft, there really isn’t a decent competitor to the iPod Touch, is there? And in some ways, it doesn’t look like there will be. But the iPad is due to see some new entrants into its market soon. How do you see these newcomers?

**iOS**: These devices are missing the one thing that makes the iPad unique.

**Mod**: and that is?

**iOS**: Me. A touch-screen computer running Windows 7 is a mongrel that will have all the tell-tale signs of its desktop heritage cobbled into a mobile platform.

**Mod**: And what about the WebOS and Android-based tablets due out in the next year or so?

**iOS**: There we may see some real challenge. Android is a formidable, if uncouth, foe. They seek victory not in the elegance and perfection of their attack, but rather in superiority of numbers.

**OSX**: I’m still here, you know.

**Mod**: So you see Android’s chances of domination resting in the number of devices that are deployed using Google’s OS, and not in the engineering quality of said OS?

**iOS**: There is little to fear, I think, in the “quality” of the Android OS. But it is free to run on any cell network, and this is worth considering.

**Mod**: This “low-cost-broad-dispersal” technique worked once before, you know.

**OSX**: Oh, bring that up, why don’t you? Look, Apple was young, they didn’t see it coming. And anyway, that was before my time.

**iOS**: We have learned from the mistakes of the past, and you may also be sanguine that we will move to exceed our rivals at every turn.

**OSX**: So I’m invisible and silent now all of the sudden, is that it? Nobody can hear me?

**Moderator**: Well, we’re out of time here. I’ve been chatting with an extremely confident iOS.

**OSX**: And me! OSX! The best desktop OS! I’m still here.

**Moderator**: Join me next time for more Fireside Chats.
