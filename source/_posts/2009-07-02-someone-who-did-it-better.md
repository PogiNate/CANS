Every once in a while I come across something so grand, so amazing, that I have to pass it on unedited[1][1] Today this gem comes from Mr. Maliki! of Wondermark.com  He found some classic humor, to which I must respectfully doff my hat and hope to imitate.  His post “[True Stuff: Metahumor from 1927][2]” ends with “A Criticism of the Theatrical Criticism in this Morning’s Paper” which is everything I wish I could be. Don Herold, I may fly higher than an eagle, but you, you are the one who did it 92 years earlier than me.
