So, while I was chatting with Steve Jobs on the phone after the “Let’s Rock” event he received a call from John Mayer. I don’t know if he meant to put it on three-way calling, or if he just meant to put me on hold, but this is a transcript of the call:

*Phone rings*

**Jobs**: Oh crap.  I gotta take this, Moltz. Hold on.

**Dickson**: Er, Dickson, actually. But Moltz is fine.

**Mayer**: Hey Steve.

**J**: Hi John.

**M**: I saw the keynote today.

**J**: Good, good.

M: You played “Gravity” as a “Genius” example. That was pretty cool.

**J**: Glad you liked that.

**M**: And some of my other songs came up as well.

**J**: Yep.

**M**: But I was surprised, there at the end, when that Hawaiian guy got up on stage.

**J**: Jack Johnson is a very talented artist, and…

**M**: I had my guitar there with me, Steve.  I was already to go.  What happened?

**J**: Look, John, I know this might be hard for you, but we’ve moved on.

**M**: Moved on? You can’t leave me, Steve! You need me! Apple needs me!

**J**: John, don’t make this harder than it already is. Bono didn’t get all whiny like this when we stopped making the U2 special edition iPod.

**M**: What about that one keynote? And that other keynote? I rocked the house!

**J**: You performed adequately, yes, but…

**M**: I mean, I can understand bringing in Randy Newman from time to time. You basically own his soul, right?

**J**: Well, Pixar did, which means Disney does, so basically yes, but…

**M**: So he’s okay; he’s fine. But Jack Johnson? Some wimpy hyper-mellow…

**D**: Maybe I should just go…

**J**: Quiet, Moltz.

**D**: Dickson. But Moltz is fine!

**J**: Whatever. Listen, John, your time has passed. You’ll still show up in cover flows or as a “favorite song” in a playlist here or there but your star has set.

**M**: What’s that Johnson got that I don’t got?

**J**: Grammar, for one.  Also, he’s personable, John. He tells jokes. He connects with the audience.

**M**: I can tell jokes! I can connect!

**J**: You look like a stuffed iguana trying to sing, John. Let’s face it. You were hot for a while because of that real world song, and that wonderland song, but…(*tinny snippet of “[Upside Down][1]” starts playing*) Look, John, it’s over. Goodbye. And Moltz, I told you stop calling me. (*click*)

**D**: Dickson… Oh who cares. (*to self*) I could never be as good as John Moltz…

**M**: (*to self*) I could never be as good as Jack Johnson…
