Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we hop right up on that bandwagon and take your questions about the not-actually-released-to-the-general-public iPad!

Q: So how do you like it so far?

A: I’m sorry?

Q: Your review iPad? How is it?

A: Oh, right, the…the review iPad that Apple sent me. Yeah. It’s great stuff. I mean, it’s all… all shiny, and…full of features…[1][1]

Q: You don’t have a review iPad, do you?

A: No, I totally do! It’s right here! In…in fact, I’m writing these responses on it right now!

Q: Why don’t you have a review unit? I mean, Pogue does, that one[ really hard to spell][2] guy does, Gruber probably has four, heck, even [Stephen Fry][3] got one. But they just skipped right over you, huh?

A: I don’t know what you’re talking about! I’m using that iPad all day every day! 

Q: I mean, Pogue, of course. And Mossberg, sure. Even Gruber’s a given, because he’d whine really really loud if they didn’t give him one to play with. But then there’s you. Left out. In the cold.

A: I know! What’s up with that? Of all those guys, I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who has been Apple Product Professional Platinum Certified from 2005-2009 continuously[2][4] Mossberg wouldn’t know how to strategically position the value of MobileMe if he had Nimitz, Sherman and Patton helping him! If anyone could help them move ‘Pads, it’s me. But no. Just give ‘em to the noisy guys. Hmph.

 [4]: #footnote_1_768 "No, really, I have. Every year."

Q: You wanna talk about it?

A: No. I’ma go sulk until I get in line to buy an iPad tomorrow. Like all the normal people.

Q: All the “normal people” with $500-$800 to chuck at a new toy.

A: Dude, these are *Apple *people. 

Q: Right, right. Sorry. Forgot there for a second. 

A: Well, you’re new. It’s forgivable. This time.
