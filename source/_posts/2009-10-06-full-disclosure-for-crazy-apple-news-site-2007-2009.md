In order to be fully compliant with [this new guideline][1], the CANS staff does hereby make the following disclosure:

 [1]: http://www.macworld.com/article/143135/2009/10/bloggers_ftc.html?lsrc=rss_main

In the 1.5 years we have been covering Apple news and events, we have received the following material considerations:

*   **From Apple, Inc, their subsidiary and affiliate companies:** Nothing, valued at $0.
*   **From Microsoft, and former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates:** Nothing, valued at $0.
*   **From New York Times Columnist David Pogue:** 1 less-than-thrilled comment on an article we wrote a while ago, valued at roughly 20 new hits on our site from people who saw that thing I put on twitter.

We hope this will help you make more informed decisions about our trustworthiness as a source of Crazy Apple News.

We called ourselves for a statement on these numbers but we were unwilling to comment.
