Q: That’s cool. So what is on YouTube?

A: Well, there’s people sitting in their room spouting angry invective against any and all political parties, rebroadcast commercials, video game walkthroughs, really grainy music videos put up by record labels in a dying attempt to stay relevant…senior projects…political videos…

Q: Y-Yeeah. Hey, know what, bro? I’m gonna stick to the surf videos, ‘kay?

A: Yeah. That’s probably for the best.

Q: Sweet. Later, bro!
