Well, no, nobody’s dead. I’m just tired of calling it meta-live blogging or pseudo-live blogging or some such thing. So I came up with this really emo title instead. Now you’d think I’d come up with a  better title. But you’d be wrong. This is what we’re going with.

 

The point is, Time-stamped hilarity is coming your way later today. I’m not dead. I think I’ll go for a walk.
