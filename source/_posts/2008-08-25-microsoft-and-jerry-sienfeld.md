Microsoft feels that the best way to counteract the market’s move towards Apple products is to hire [Jerry Seinfeld][1] to appear with Bill Gates[1][2]  in an attempt to get people to take Vista seriously.

Well, this makes perfect sense to us here at CANS.  I mean, look at how much Apple’s stock has gone up in the last few months since CANS went live!  Clearly, there is a link between the number of people who make jokes about a computing platform and how popular it is.

The great thing is that we all know this is only the beginning. If this Seinfeld thing works at all, they’ll buy up every comedian they can get, and I for one can’t wait.  Personally, I’m hoping that [Carrot][3] [Top][4] is the next one tapped to hawk Mr. Ballmer’s wares. I feel his painful, grating voice and irritatingly over-the-top appearance would make him the truest face of Windows Vista. The fact that he seems to be putting on insane amounts of muscle–presumably to get people to stop making fun of him–only adds to the appeal. But until that’s official, why don’t we all guess about it for a while. Make this a more interactive post for once.  Why don’t you all talk about it? Who do you think Microsoft should hire to try to make Apple look less attractive?

Talk amongst yourselves.
