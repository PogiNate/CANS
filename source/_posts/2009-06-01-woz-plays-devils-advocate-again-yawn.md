Woz Bing Apple Co Founder a “Big Fan” of Microsoft’s New Search Engine: Tech Ticker, Yahoo Finance.

The world was rocked to the core by Steve Wozniak wholeheartedly endorsing Microsoft’s soon-to-be launched new search engine Bing.

“Wow. I’m, totally surprised that the Woz would do such a thing,” said Tim Cook, Acting CEO of Apple. “This is the first time he’s done something so not-Apple and gotten a bunch of publicity from it. Is he still wearing that pink shirt?”

Others were equally shocked. “Woz likes the Microsoft thing, huh? Wow. I’m really  really  (yawn) shocked,” said Phil Schiller. “Of course, Apple doesn’t make a search engine, so it’s not really attacking us is it?  But I’m sure people will sit up and…[several second pause as Phil gets distracted by a YouTube video on his iPhone] what were we talking about? Oh, right, Woz and that Microsoft thing.  Right.  Um… Yep, it sure is a big deal.”

Microsoft hopes that instead of “Googling” things, by 2011 we’ll all be “bing-ing” things.  Unfortunately, like the Palm Pre and the Zune HD, Bing is still something that regular people can’t actually judge for themselves.
