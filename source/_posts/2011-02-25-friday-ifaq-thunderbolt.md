Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

this week we talk about the newest thing in physical IO: LightPeak Thunderbolt!

 

Q: So, What makes Thunderbolt better than other stuff?

A: Speed. Pure, unbridled fastness. Faster than fast, and daisy-chainable, Thunderbolt is–

Q: a lot like Firewire. You know, Apple’s last failed attempt at pushing a new IO specification on all of us. All they do is force LaCie to make a few hard drives that are outlandishly expensive because they use non-standard ports.

A: Firewire isn’t a failed technology! It’s just not…fully embraced.

Q: What about ExpressCard?

A: ExpressCard…could have done better, sure, but–

Q: And Firewire

A: you already said that one.

Q: Ah, but I was talking about Firewire 800 this time.

A: Okay,well, yeah, Firewire 800 hasn’t really taken off, athough there are people that use it.

Q: We’ll call them “People who use macs to make movies” and move on.

A: It’s not Just…okay, fair enough. But Thunderbolt is–

Q: A lot like the [ADC][1]?

 [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Display_Connector

A: We don’t talk about the ADC around here.

Q: Face it, Apple makes a lot of amazing technology, but they just don’t drive hardware standards. Pretty much every connector they champion ends up in second place. Look at DisplayPort.

A: Hey, now, you can’t call DisplayPort a failed connector yet! It’s still in the works! Dell is using it! Lots of people are using it!

Q: To connect to Apple Cinema Displays. 

A: Right. No! To connect to all kinds of high end monitors. And besides, what about all the changes that Apple has made? What about the death of the Floppy drive? or the death of the stylus?

Q: Granted, they’re good at showing the world what our hardware should do, or rather, what it should stop doing. I mean, using a stylus, remember that?

A: Always losing it, trying to get your finger to be precise enough on those terrible resistive displays…

Q: Or using a ballpoint pen lid, because if you used the actual pen you’d get your screen all covered in ink.

A: Yeah, those were the terrible old days. Learning some new way to write so it would more-or-less understand your handwriting–

Q: But of course, half the time you just gave up and used the on-screen keyboard.

A: Well sure, it was faster to hunt and peck than scratch and swear.

Q: Yep, yep. Well, I guess Apple has made a difference after all.

A: That’s right.

Q: Be that as it may, Thunderbolt still isn’t going to ever be popular.

A: …I know.
