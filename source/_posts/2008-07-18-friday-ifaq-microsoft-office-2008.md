Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

Today: High-school goth poets answer your questions about Microsoft Office 2008.

Q: Excel 2007 has this cool feature on Windows where you can just set a range of colors for a range of values and it will apply conditional formatting to a column. Can you do that in Excel 2008?

A: Black is the color of my soul,  
Dripping sadness runs through my hair and stains the ground with my agony.  
I cannot move my hands; the weight of my soul has surpassed my will.

Q: Word seems to take a long time to load on my mac mini, even with 2GB of RAM. What can I do to speed it up?

A: I sink into the flood of your hate in the Cathedral of the Indifferent,  
the black candles casting raven-fluttering shadows as I try escape.  
But alas! I cannot run as fast as my eyeliner runs in my tears.

Q: Will PowerPoint ever *not* suck?

A: Cruel, sharpenéd lights stab my eyes!  
Hardened heart, darkened soul, turn from my feelings!  
Hot Topic stopped carrying leather pants in my size  
And I can no longer fit in my old ones.

Q: Um… Entourage?

A: But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted  
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!  
A savage place! as holy and enchanted  
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover![1][1]
