Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This Week: Plex: all media for ever and ever amen.

Q: I hate Front Row!

A: Fight the power!

Q: All it shows me is things I already have!

A: And trailers!

Q: I want something that shows me something else. Something new!

A: Something strange…

Q: Something different…

A: Poorly made YouTube parodies of famous songs…

Q: Low-bitrate movies…

A: The last five episodes of “The Simpsons”…

Q: Web Comics…

A: And most of all, I want it to hijack the Apple Remote!

Q: Like stealing a Jedi’s Lightsaber! 

A: Yeah!…Er, no, no, that doesn’t make any sense.

Q: And we were doing so well. Oh well.

A: We were. So, to sum up: you want a multi-media powerhouse on your Mac. 

Q: Yes. And it needs to be tastefully done.

A: Of course. 

Q: And not too expensive.

A: Right, right.

Q: And with a little path…

A: Look, just say “ni!” and get it over with, alright? I ain’t cutting anything down with a herring.

Q: I uh, I don’t know what you’re talking about…

A: Riiiiight. Anyway, I think I can solve your problem.

Q: Great! That’ll save me thousands in therapy costs.

A: Maybe not that problem.

Q: Oh well. Doctor said we could cut back to three sessions a week if I promise not to say the words “penguin on your TV” this week…drat.

A: …Aaaaaanyway, What you want is Plex! That’s right Plex, with new addititve GLC 9424075[1][1] …

 [1]: #footnote_0_486 "after 6 p.m., 9424048"

Q: whose side are you on? Stop that! And anyway, it’s “after 6 p.m., 942404*7*“, not *8*

A: My mistake. Anyway, Plex, regardless of additives, is an open-source media thingy. It hijacks your Apple Remote, lets you watch YouTube and Hulu and Netflix and all that stuff–

Q: That sounds exactly perfect!

A: And only crashes about once every three launches.

Q: Not so perfect, then.

A: Not yet, no. But with your continued support of the project, soon Plex will be giving Front Row a run for it’s money in both the features category and the non-sucking category!

Q: what do you mean by “support”?

A: Oh, just any little gesture of appreciation… you know, anything you can do…

Q: I’m afraid I don’t follow you…

A: Look, couldn’t you just give them a dollar?

Q: Yes, but you see, I don’t know what it’s for.

A: Well, they’ll use it to help other people work on Plex.

Q: No, no, no, I don’t follow this at all, I mean, I don’t want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I’m a dollar down on the whole deal.

A: Gotcha!

Q: … Drat.
