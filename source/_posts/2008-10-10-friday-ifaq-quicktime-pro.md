Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

Today we take a look at QuickTime Pro.

Q: So, how is QuickTime Pro different from regular QuickTime?

A: QuickTime pro takes your video experiences to a whole new level, with a stunning H.264 codec and concurrent viewing/editing features.

Q: So I can watch one movie and edit another at the same time?

A: Yep.

Q: That’d be great, if I was Data from Star Trek.  What kindsa features you got for normal people?

A: Well, I shouldn’t tell you this, but, (*whispers*) *You can record QuickTime videos off the Internet!*

Q: Um, Apple advertises that on their site. It’s not a secret. And it’s really not a big thing, either.

A: Good, good, play it cool. We don’t want everyone to know, or it’ll cost $1000 to go to a movie[1][1] next year.

Q: You stole that from Apple’s site, didn’t you?

A: Yes, Ironically enough, I did. But as you can see, there are many good reasons to purchase a Pro license. You can record video from your iSight camera, and send it to your friends! You have friends, right?

Q: Yes of course I have friends.  That’s not the question.

A: Because a lot of people who question Mac products don’t have friends.

Q: Wha?

A: Paul Thurrott, for example.

Q: Nobody said it was worthless, I just…

A: Rob Enderle questioned the majesty of Apple, and look how he died.

Q: He’s still alive, last I heard.

A: That’s not the point. Do you want to end up like Rob Enderle or do you want to record movies from your iSight and send them to your friends?

Q: You make a compelling argument. I can see how QuickTime Pro would be useful if I made small simple movies, but I’m tired of movie makers that don’t have adaptively tuned in-loop deblocking filters, or 4×4 integer transform.

A: Now who’s reading Apple’s website?

Q: What does all that stuff even mean?

A: I told you: Use QuickTime Pro, or end up like Enderle.  That’s what all that stuff means.

Q: Okay, you got me. I’ll buy a license.

A: Good. All your friends will thank you.

Q: I don’t actually have all that many friends.

A: Tell me about it.
