This is just a quick note to let you know that, whatever you've been doing, whatever you've been expecting, you can now expect this blog to have[^footnotes].

We've been working on this since we switched blogging engines. You know, three or four days ago.

Now that we're back in style expect some awesome posts about iPhone speculation and other such awesomeness. Feel free to suggest topics in the comments section as well.

[^footnotes]: Footnotes.
