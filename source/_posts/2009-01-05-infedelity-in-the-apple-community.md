So, Mr. Moltz finally admits that he’s left the pure world of Apple blogging in favor of [fear mongering][1].  And frankly we here at CANS are shocked, shocked and offended that he would be running this shameful side project.  You can rest assured that CANS is our highest online priority, and that neither I nor any of the Ruby Ninja Androids would even think of running [any other][2] [web][3] [sites][4]…

Oh, those.  Right.  Um.  Well, CANS is always first, you know that, baby.  C[2]N means nothing to me[1][5] …Yes, I know I opened a web store with C[2]N shirts, but It’s never sold any!  C’mon, you know I love CANS most! Awww, now don’t be like that!…
