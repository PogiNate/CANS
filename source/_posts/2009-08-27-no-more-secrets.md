Shocking news from the world of Apple Fandom today as an AP poll shows that there are absolutely no surprises left for those who shell out for Apple’s newest release of OSX.  

“The blogs have covered everything,” said an unnamed operative.[1][1] “From really, really obvious features like the new QuickTime X to really boring things like the OpenCL framework, every single facet of Snow Leopard has been covered.  I  mean, there have been long, in-depth articles about a “malware protection system” that watches for two packages! What’s that all about?”

The dearth of new material on the arctic cat has left the Apple Blogging Community[2][2] with a bit of a problem on their hands.

“What do we write about?  It’s still to early to start guessing on the code name for 10.7. We’ll have to wait until at least next week for that,” said Leo Laporte. 

“I disagree,” disagreed John Gruber, who went on to claim that Apple would name 10.7 “Fireball” after his own illustrious self. 

“Let’s face it, I put the Missing Manual to bed six months ago, and since then it’s just been trying to weasel things out from under the NDA.  Now that we’re allowed to talk about it, there’s not really anything left to cover, other than the…oops, that feature’s still under NDA, I forgot. Well, you’ll see,” said a more-smug-than-usual David Pogue.

Those wishing to console the despondent Apple bloggers suggested they talk about rumors of be-camera’ed[3][3] iPods or the coming Apple tablet, but these suggestions were met with moist snorts of derision.  “Out of the frying pan into the fire” was how the Macalope put it.

but fear not, gentle readers! CANS has found the one thing that no other blog has covered, and we will be providing exclusive coverage of that mysterious new thing, the one Apple product upgrade of which no one else knows, right after this week’s iFAQ.

Stay Tuned!
