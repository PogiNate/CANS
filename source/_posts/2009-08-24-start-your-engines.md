Early this morning, every member of the Apple “community”[1][1] started vibrating at about 20Hz.

“It’s coming!” they[2][2] said in unison at 6:45 PDT.  Several people were heard to growl like cats.  
“The 28th! That’s only (carry the one…add three…) seven days from today! No, wait, FOUR! that’s four days from now!” squealed Walt Mossberg, immediately starting his glowing review of the nascent OS.   
“What? I’ve been running snow leopard for two [expeletive deleted] years now.  No big deal,” said John Gruber.  
For those of us that don’t get free beta copies of unreleased releases, Friday is now officially a big deal™.  We’ll keep you posted on further developments in the community’s response as they happen.
