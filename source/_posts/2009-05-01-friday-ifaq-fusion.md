Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and  
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy  
Apple products.

This week: The virtualizer that generates less radioactive waste than fission: Fusion!

Q: That was not good. Your intro was hard to understand and I wasn’t able to understand it easily.

A: C’mon, it was great.

Q: I want to run Linux.

A: Really.

Q: Yes.  And I want to run Linux in a virtual machine. On my Mac.

A: Do you.

Q: Yes.

A: Why?

Q: Because Linux is true and faithful and strong.  Linux is a great operating system that has power and strength.  And I have need of it.

A: Do you need a guide?

Q: I have seen many summers, on the plains. I have much experience that will aid those of fewer summers. 

A: But to compute well and true and faithfully requires more.

Q: Yes. I will have need of your services if I am to install Linux.  I have not yet done that, and I will need to.  You must help me.

A: I will assist you.

Q: That is good. And once I have installed Linux, then I will help you work on your Hemingway impression. It is not enough to use short, repetitive sentences.  To truly imitate Hem is a great quest, dangerous and prone to fall in to clichés. When a post falls into a cliché it can’t climb back out by itself, and it takes many strong men to pull it back to the surface.  I have seen strong men weep when they have lost a post in the morass. 

A: Hem once shot himself in both legs while firing a machine gun at a shark in Bimini.

Q: What does that have to do with Linux and posts?

A: Nothing.

Q: Then let us embark on our quest.  What must I do to procure the Linux?

A: Seek it on the internets. You will find it in ISOs on many sites. You must look deep and far and wide.

Q: I have found them on Google. I will use the one with the Lizard.

A: The Lizard will serve you well. Go then, and download the ISO. Fusion itself will now be your guide.

Q: Thank you. I will remember you. And I will remember my promise to teach you the ways of imitating Hemingway.
