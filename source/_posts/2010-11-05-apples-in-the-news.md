We don’t have the time to think up a brilliant Q&A session this week as we’re feverishly writing stuff about all knowing techno-smart-alecs and people who might or might not be dryads. So instead we’re going to take a page from other tech commentator’s books and comment on recent news-type events that have happened recently. This should be fun.

**Cooks Source Steals Content**: We’re not sure why [this story][1] got such heavy coverage, but it surely did–for about five minutes. Expect this story to die down quickly and nobody on the entire internet to remember anything about Illadore or Cooks Source magazine by the end of next week. This story isn’t really *Apple *related, but it is *apple *related, as the recipe in question was for apple pie.

**Apple Hates Flash Round II**: Apple pundits are jumping on the Flash-hating bandwagon, and discovering that the Flash plugin kills laptop batteries faster than something that kills something else in around four hours. So discount spider spray and big hairy spiders maybe. Or hand sanitizer and cold germs. I don’t know. I don’t keep a handy list of things that kill other things in around four hours on my person at all times. That seems kinda morbid. Oh, wait, I got one: “…the Flash Plugin kills laptop batteries faster than The BBC’s eight-hour-long Pride and Prejudice miniseries kills any modern male’s will to live.” Yeah, that’ll work.

**Apple Hates the XServe**: Sad but true. Apple will stop making XServes in 2011. We don’t know why. The Mac mini Server is a fearsome piece of technology, but not *that *fearsome, for Pete’s sake. Maybe Apple was looking at the new data centers they’re building and realizing that even they don’t have enough money to fill them with XServes. Maybe they’ve decided that anything even remotely businesslike is outside of their sphere of concern, and in coming months we’ll see an End-of-life announcement for the PowerMac Mac Pro as well. Maybe the future of Apple is wall-to-wall iPads as far as the eye can see, with an occasional MacBook Air thrown in here and there. We’re not sure. All we know is that the one time we were tasked with keeping an XServe up and running it was a finicky, picky diva of a server and made our lives miserable, unlike the Windows and Linux servers we were running alongside it. On the other hand it had the prettiest User Interface, so that has to count for something.

**The Big Bang Theory Don’t Know Macs**: In a recent[1][2] episode of The Big Bang Theory one of the characters dressed up like an Apple Store “Genius” in order to pick up women. The plausibility of this scenario to one side[2][3] , The character says that he was “showing this hot girl how to boot into safe mode…” and that’s what nearly caused me to spew apple cider all over my Apple computer. “Macs don’t have a ‘Safe Mode’!!!” I thought with multiple exclamation points. “Windows has a ‘Safe Mode! There’s no way he could be ‘booting into safe mode’ on a Mac!”

 [3]: #footnote_1_993 "I spent years working a job that had a minor tech-support component to it. While it’s true that I often assisted a certain six-foot-tall blonde ballerina with her Mac problems there was never any spark of growing romance, nascent ardor, or increasing passion involved with the job. If history has taught us anything, it’s taught us that tech support is not the basis for budding romance."

“Unless the hot girl had Boot Camp set up on her machine.” A part of my brain that likes to argue with me suggested.

“Well, yeah, but still, he should be helping her with Apple problems if he’s pretending to be working at the Genius Bar.”

“Maybe the real Geniuses don’t handle Windows problem, and that was his edge.”

“Look, shaddup. You’re ruining my perfectly good sense of outrage here. I get so very few of them.”

“Sorry about that. Okay. As you were.”

But it was no good. The moment was lost. So you can be outraged or not as you choose about this glaring mistake in an otherwise pretty good show.

Well, that’s all we have for today. Feel free to drop any other Appley newsy things you may find relevant in the comments. We’ll be watching the comments with one eye while simultaneously trying to figure out why one of our protagonists is trying to turn into an antagonist and ALSO trying to write at least 1667 words a day.[3][4]
