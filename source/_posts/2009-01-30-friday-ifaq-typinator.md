Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we help you get more from less with Typinator, the text-expander that isn’t TextExpander.

Q: Im to lasy to typ wrds right, y know, dood?

A: I see.

Q: but ppl are alws givin me crap cuz I when I write I snd stoopid, n I want to snd smrt.

A: Eesh. You do have a problem! You could just learn to use the English language properly.

Q: Do I hv to?

A: \*Sigh\* No. There is another way. But it will take some work. Specifically, you’ll have to work to earn the cash to buy a program.

Q: Wht prgrm?

A: Seriously, this is getting out of hand. The program is called Typinator. It’s pretty cool. It allows you to program in text abbreviations that are then automatically expanded into the word you want. For example, you could program it to change “ppl” to “people”

Q: “ppl” isnt rt?

A: No. And seriously, go get a copy and use it or take the time to write properly or so help me…

Q: alright!… [three hours of adding codes later] Hey, this is pretty cool! I write like a human being now!

A: Ahhh, much better! Now you are ready for the more advanced uses of Typinator!

Q: There are advanced uses?

A: Yes, my young apprentice! For example, Typinator can keep you from losing your job.

Q: How?

A: Let’s say you want to call your boss an “arrogant, self-absorbed baby in a cheap suit”…

Q: It’s like you read my mind!

A: … But that would get you fired. So you tell Typinator to replace “arrogant” with “intelligent”, “self-absorbed” with “decisive” and “baby in a cheap suit” with “leader who molds his team into a streamlined selling machine”. That way you can type what you mean, but the boss will see what he wants, and you’ll get that big promotion!

Q: It’s like magic!

A: Just make sure you spell all the words correctly, or you’ll get something like “intelligent, decisive babby in a cheap suit”.

Q: What if babby cant frigth back?

A: … You didn’t.

Q: What?

A: Nevermind. Ugh. Anyway. Have fun sounding like a human being!

Q: Kthxbai!

A: What was that?

Q: Hold on… [adds new expansion] Okay, thank you very much, au reviour!

A: Much better.
