Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: iMovie ’09, the “You win this time, Pogue!” edition.

Q: Didn’t you already do iMovie?

A: Well, yeah, but that was version ’08. This is version ’09.

Q: Like that really matters with these things. I seem to recall that last time, you wrote about someone making a “space pirate ninja elf romance”.

A: Didn’t you have some questions? Please?

A: Thank you, officer!

Q: But don’t let me see you without your Blogger’s License again! 

A: You won’t, I promise. 

Q: And a little new content every now and again wouldn’t hurt either. Smarten the place up a bit, you know.

A: Yes sir! I’ll get right on that.

Q: You do that. Well, kid, I gotta run. Be good. I’ll be seein’ ya. [walks out door]

A: Man! Someone has got to do something about that Gruber. I mean, it was cute at first, but now…
