…Missouri.  We’re not going that crazy.

Yes, in less than three hours I will be on a plane headed for beautiful Columbia Missouri for a 3-night 4-day all-expenses-paid top-secret business trip.  Expect sporadic updates on Twitter[1][1] and occasional daily journals.  Yes, I know daily journals would be expected to happen daily. But you never know what perils I will face *east of the Rockies!*

So, if you know of any fun things to do in Columbia let me know in the comments, and if you actually live in Columbia, you’re probably a student at Ol’ Missou.
