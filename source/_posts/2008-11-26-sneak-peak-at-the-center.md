You know how, when they release movie trailers, sometimes they put all the best parts of the movie into the trailer?  This isn’t one of those kinds.  This is a scene that wasn’t working out at all, draft after draft, and  I needed to move on.  The version you see here is nothing like what will be in the novel, but I had fun writing it and thought you might enjoy it.

Oh, and “Guard” and “Big Mama” *are* their names.  The main character is Jason. This starts out from his point of view, and switches to Guard a little way in.

## Guard’s Story: Act III

Guard was already seated when I got there, so I sat down facing him,  and noticed how little it hurt to do things like sit down and move around these days.  I was almost whole again!  But now was not the time to worry about my side.  Guard was going to tell me what had happened next, and I was more than ready to find out.  
He waited until I was comfortably seated, then began.

I was not popular around the village after that. (Guard said.)  The raid had been particularly savage, and the raiders had made it known that they were after me and my new little ideas.  Many accused me of wasting time talking when I could have spent that time breaking more of our attackers’ faces.  Many accused me of inviting their wrath in my pride, and my bad attitude.  I said that they were welcome to do what they thought best, and that all I had ever done was work for the good of the village, but nobody wanted to hear that again.  
I really didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t want to go back to raiding, because I couldn’t see how it was right to take from others what we could get for ourselves.  I didn’t want to give up my studies for war training.  
I wasn’t getting anywhere, and I knew that I wouldn’t, so long as I was trying to figure things out on my own.  I knew someone who could help, but I really, really didn’t want to go to her for help.  Still, I had no other option.  I went and found the fat bossy lady from the other village.  
She was sitting outside her house, looking pleased with herself as usual, and not doing a whole lot.  When she saw me coming she nodded, then waited for me to take a seat before talking.  
“So, people aren’t as easy to please as you thought. And sometimes you need to hit someone a little bit. The question is; what are you going to do about it?  How do you propose to handle your little problem?”  
“I don’t know.”  
“What did I tell you last time?”  
“Something about pure force.  What happened to intelligence?”  
“You need to know where to push, sure, but some things won’t go away by talking.  Sometimes you need to act. Sometimes what you do won’t work, but at least you will have tried.”  
“This part of the story isn’t very easy to write, is it?”  
“No, son, this part is getting pretty sticky and hard to get moving on at all.”  
I looked at her for a second. Things weren’t going the way we expected.  
“What should we do to make things work better?”  
“Well, the Author’s had a hard enough time; why don’t we skip ahead to the real point of this scene, and go from there? And on the way, we’ll summarize what we are supposed to say in this section!”  
I liked the way she was thinking.  It would get us out of a terribly slow and convoluted part of the story.  We started walking through the plot, ignoring narrative theory, and talking over what we should have been doing.  
“So, Guard, here’s the part where you try to turn away from your true path, once again.”  
“Yep. Here’s where you remind me of what I’m meant to be, and what I can do to really make myself what I’m supposed to be.  I mean, you know, where you tell me about protecting those who need it, moving against the evils that beset us all, and what I can do to use my brain to carefully and properly direct my force.”  
“Oogh, I forgot about this part.  Why did you fight me so hard, anyway?”  
I grinned a little, something I wouldn’t do in story.  “I didn’t want to believe that my whole purpose in life is to hit people.”  
“Well, you’ve learned better by the time the story picks up, right?”  
“Well, I’m still brooding, you see.  I’m angry, frustrated, and I want to know that I can do more.  I mean, look at this fight scene.  I don’t even remember it; because I’m berserk in that scene.” I watched for a moment. “I got some good hits in though, didn’t I?”  
“That’s my Guard!” Big Mama laughed.  “Oh, be careful, you almost tripped over the burning building, where you weren’t able to save the crops.”  
“I sure did.  That scene is some pretty rough ground. It could use some work before it’s really ready to be in any book.  I mean, burning crops? What is the Author thinking?”  
“Well, as long as it makes the end symbolic, that’s fine.” She responded warmly, mostly so you could remember who was saying what.  
“Okay, so, here we are at the beach where you decide to come with me, be my bodyguard, and learn the true and right uses of who you are and what you do. Are you ready to get back into the story line?” She asked.  I sighed.  
“Okay. I don’t like this scene, but the Author just marked this whole section as a “crappy draft”, so we can at least rest in the knowledge that it’ll be changed before too long.”  
“Thank goodness. Okay, places everyone!” Big Mama said, then we stepped back into the story line.  It tingled.

**\***|**

“So, kid, what’s it gonna be? You gonna stay on this island and hate yourself for fighting off attackers, or are you gonna come with me and learn how to do what needs done when it needs done?”

“Do I have a choice?”“Of course.  You always have a choice.  You can be a nobody or you can be your best self. It’s up to you. It always has been.”I sighed.  She was right.  I knew there was more for me out there with her than there was here, fighting people I didn’t want to fight for causes I didn’t believe in.  I stepped onto the ship, and the rest is history.

Ta-daaa!  I should be done in time, without even stretching too much. Oh, and the fourth wall stays completely intact in the real novel, don’t worry.  No [post-modernism][1] here! Thanks again for your support!
