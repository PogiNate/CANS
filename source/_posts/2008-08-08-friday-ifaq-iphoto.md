Every Friday[1][1]  we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and  
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy  
Apple products.

In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each week, we have declared August** iLife Month**. Every Friday this month we will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.

This week: iPhoto

Q: Why should I use iPhoto?

A: iPhoto allows you to store and sort all your photos in style, keeping your memories tightly and rigidly organized, with no chance of one spilling over into another.

Q: That sounds draconian!

A: You bet!

Q: What if I want to store one photo in two different events?

A: No, you can’t.  But you can create albums to  organize your photos from different events, and with your Mobile Me account–

Q: I don’t have a Mobile Me…

A: YES YOU DO HAVE A MOBILE ME ACCOUNT! ALL APPLE USERS MUST HAVE MOBILE ME ACCOUNTS! HOW CAN YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT MOSTLY-WORKING-NOW SYNC AND PUSH EMAIL?

Q: AAAGH!  “Sync and push email?” That just doesn’t sound good. Also, we did this joke last week.[2][2]

 [2]: #footnote_1_73 "and we’ll probably do it again next week!"

A: Sorry, I forgot. I don’t read iFAQ’s.  Anyway, if you *did* have a Mobile Me account, you would be able to share your pictures on the web in Mobile Me galleries, to which other people would be able to add their pictures, and all your families and friends would have a nice gallery full of shared images.

Q: Hey that would be great! and for only $99 a year!

A: Yeah!

Q: Hey, I have another question: I heard that you can print books from iPhoto. How does that work?

A: It couldn’t be simpler! just open iPhoto, choose the “book” option at the bottom, and put images into the placeholders on the virtual book pages in front of you. When you’re done, click “order book” and Apple will print your book to your specifications and send it to you, or to whomever you wish.

Q: Hey, that’s great! Now I finally have an easy way to publish that book of pictures I took of my own armpit!

A:That’s…great…?

Q: Yeah, I have all these pictures I took over time, so  I have pictures of my armpit as a kid, as a teenager, that one time when I got that bad rash, that other time when I got a worse rash, the time I… well, why am I telling you all this when I can just show you! Here, look!

A: Oh my… I’m gonna… \*erp\*

Q: Yeah, that’s a good one! Hey, I can make a full hardcover, with dust jacket!

A: Why would you want an *armpit book*?

Q: Oh, it’s not for me!  I’d send it to my friends for Christmas!  Gosh, thanks Apple!

A: We’re so glad that Apple products allow you to… share… your… look, Apple has a reputation to maintain. We want people to think all Apple users are surfers or snowboarders.  Please don’t make an armpit book using iPhoto!  That’s what places like [Lulu.com][3] are for.

Q: …And I’m done! Okay, it’s off to the printers! Wow, these Apple programs are great!  So classy and refined. And thank you for your help, iFAQ writer person!  I’m so grateful, I’m sending you a copy too!

A: I can hardly wait.
