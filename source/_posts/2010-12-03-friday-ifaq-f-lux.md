Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we help you help your eyes with the oddly-named [F.lux][1] utility.

Q: Sometimes I stay up late, doing…things. Things that…hurt me.

A: What did the common Ellipsis ever do to you?

Q: I wake up, bleary-eyed and strained. I bump into walls in the dark. I feel like a backwards vampire.

A: You lost me

Q: I can’t see in the dark, you see.

A: Okay, sure. Whatever. I thought you meant you gave women blood transplants in the neck.

Q: Gross. 

A: Right? But you’re the one that said it. Anyway, we’ve strayed pretty far afield. tell me, can you admit to me what these things are that you…do?

Q: Well, you see, I–

A: Remember to keep this family friendly.

Q: How do I say this? I edit spreadsheets.

A: Watch your mouth! We call them “Numbers Documents” around here.

Q: Okay, I edit Numbers Documents, but in Microsoft Products.

A: I thought I told you to watch your mouth!

Q: The problem is that all that white space starts to make my eyes hurt around 11:30 at night, and by 1:00 am I’m walking into walls and all wired and stuff.

A: My friend, I can help.

Q: Can you? Can you really?

A: It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick, but–Well, actually, it’ll be both. But yes, if you’re willing, I can offer you assistance.

Q: But will it be expensive? Because I’m still saving up to buy that nice new serif for little q that she wanted for Quistmas.

A: One more pun like that and so help me…

ENTIRE CAST OF MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL: **GET ON WITH IT!**

A: The answer to your problem is F.lux, a program that modifies the brightness of your monitor to match the current light at the time of day. So your screen dims at night, leaving you more ready to sleep and less prone to bump into walls. Just tell it where you live and it’ll do the rest. You’ll never have to think about it again.

Q: But what if I’m doing something that would be terrible if I played with my brightness settings?

A: Then you can tell it to change things back for an hour or so. But for the most part it quietly, subtly changes your brightness to stop destroying your night vision and ability to sleep.

Q: Why the oddly placed dot in the name, though?

A: Some mysteries were meant to stay unsolved, my friend. Savor the mystery. And your less-obliterated night vision.

Q: This I will do. Thank you. You have been most helpful. No, don’t get up, I’ll see myself out. [*runs into wall next to door, then finds door. Falls down stairs.*]

A: Sure you will.
