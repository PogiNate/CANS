Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we, like Apple, revisit iTunes, that venerable jukebox-turned-media-center.

Q: I have so…many…questions! Can’t…ask…all…them!

A: Easy there, J.T.Kirk! Take a deep breath, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, what’s on your mind?

Q: Ping? Why? Why? Life was so good, I was using my iPod, syncing with my library, watchin’ some movies in front row, and now **BOOM**!

A: Loud…

Q: Everybody I know is spying on me! Maybe even people I don’ t know are spying on me? I always feel like/ somebody’s watching me! (And I have no privacy!)

A: I’m gonna have that song in my head all day now, you realize that, don’t you?

Q: I have it queued up on iTunes 10 right now! It’s in my “Top 25″! But now, thanks to Ping! EVERYBODY knows that!

A: Listen, sparky, it’s an opt-in service! You didn’t have to opt-in! Nobody forced you.

Q: Oh come *on*! I’m a computer geek! There was a button, I pushed it! It’s what I do; it’s who I am. But I’m starting to have second thoughts.

A: That would imply you had first thoughts…

Q: I don’t really feel like I’m getting all that much out of the service, you know? I mean, All the stuff Lady Gaga and U2 are posting on Ping is also posted on Facebook, Twitter, and all the other “social” networking places that are basically just free billboards these days.

A: How very cynical of you to say so.

Q: And my friends, who aren’t button-pushing geeks, aren’t on Ping, so it’s just me and the celebs, me paying attention to them, them ignoring me. It’s like that I year I spent in New York with high-powered binoculars all over again.

A: Should I be calling the authorities?

Q: So, I guess that’s the real question.

A: Whether or not I should call the cops?

Q: No! What’s the point? Why do I need another social network? That centers around music, and is tied to my music? What do I get out of the experience?

A: Apple says you can find new music…

Q: Pandora does it better…

A: Follow your friends and your favorite bands…

Q: Like I said, Facebook and Twitter work just fine…

A: And–yeah, I don’t know. I’ve been trying to see the point all day too, it’s just not there.

Q: Sorry to bring you down like that, man.

A: Nah, it’s all right. I’ll be fine.

Q: Hey, listen, you wanna go see a concert or something?

A: Sure. How will we figure out what’s in town though?
