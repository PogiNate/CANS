Fans of really slick interactions probably use LaunchBar will be excited to know that [Quicksilver][1], the famous keyboard-based productivity app, is [rising][2] once again from the grave to speed your interactions with all them files on your hard drive.[1][3]

Open Source wonks will tell you that this is the value of Open Source, that a project can live on beyond it’s original owner losing interest.[2][4] Guardians of Commercial software would gently point out that the whole point of paying for software is to ensure that you don’t have to wait for the developer to go on spring break to get new features. Maybe someday we’ll do a fireside chat ‘bout that, but for now, feel free to go get a new version of QS if you’re not already using LaunchBar and start doing really zippy things like pasting text into a file without opening it or whatever.
