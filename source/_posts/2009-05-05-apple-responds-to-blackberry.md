Yes, the war of the fruits is on, as RIM announced that Blackberry has displaced the iPhone as the number 1 smart phone in the USA during the first quarter of the new year. As you would expect, the Apple executive board had some calm, measured suggestions for combating the growing threat of the aggregate berry.

“Ponies! Free ponies with every iPhone! F’real this time!” suggested Jony Ive, mostly because he’s easier to spell than Peter Oppenheimer. “Everybody likes ponies!” But Tim Cook wasn’t moved.

“If you aren’t calling on an iPhone, I’m not listening,” was Al Gore’s input. Actually, it turned out to be a statement of fact, not an advertising campaign. Still, while the eletist card is always good, Steve Jobs didn’t see it as really carrying the day.

“The more goodest phone ever,” said Phil Schiller, drawing upon the surprisingly successful ads for the iPod Touch. But neither Tim nor Steve thought this was the way to victory.

Finally, after looking at Wikipedia and learning how to spell his name, Peter Oppenheimer chimed in. 

“David Pogue uses an iPhone.”

  
  
Yes! Apple would rely on the draw of David Pogue, that Tzar of Twitter, the Czar of Circuits, the Caesar of Semiconductors[1][1]. They knew that if the 270,000 Fans Of Pogue knew the telephonic whims of their master they would fall in line. And that 270,000 would be enough to put the iPhone back where it belongs.
