In a desperate attempt to create a recurring feature, we have decided to start the Friday iFAQ, a list of inFrequently Asked Questions to help you, the Mac user, get more out of your software.

**Q**: A FAQ for iCal? Really?  
** A**: Yes! iCal has so much to offer that people never know about!  
** Q**: Okay. So, here goes: How do I sync my iCal and Google calendars?  
** A**: You can easily track your Google calendar in iCal by publishing your Google calendar in the iCal format, an industry standard format that…  
** Q**: No no no, I don’t just want to track my Google calendar, I want actual synchronization.  
** A**: **Don’t cut me off!**  
** Q**: Ummm, sorry? Anyway, how does that work?  
** A**: Well, if you have a .Mac account, you can have your iCal calendars published in iCal format, which Google calendar can read, so you can conveniently see your iCal events on your Google calendar.  
** Q**: That’s the same problem in reverse. I don’t want to see my calendar in two places, I want to be able to edit it in two places.  
** A**: Did you know that Apple pioneered the iCal format?  
** Q**: I guessed from the name. Also, your second option costs, like, a hundred bucks a year, so it’s not really all that convenient. Look, is there or isn’t there a way to actually sync your Google calendar and iCal?  
** A**: The strength of the Mac platform is its developers.  BusyMac has created [BusySync][1], a convenient tool for syncing calendars over a LAN or even with Google calendar.  
** Q**: So I need third-party software?  
** A**: Or you could use [Spanning Sync][2], except it costs more and has [issues with Leopard][3].  
** Q**: So you’re recommending slightly broken third party software?  
** A**: Or you could just forget all about Google calendar. Forget…Forget…Foghat…Gorfet…  
** Q**: Did you just accidentally hypnotize yourself?  
** A**: Boba Fett…Jengo Fett…  
** Q**: Okay, whatever.  I’ma go read [TUAW][4].  
** A**: Zzzzzzzzzzz……
