The news that Steve Jobs is again taking medical leave has opened the door for anti-Apple pundits to try to sound sincere in their lack of vitriol towards the man who essentially started the personal computing revolution.

“There’s nothing better than false sincerity in a situation like this,” said Une Real, a made-up professor studying the effects of being terribly small-minded and vindictive on the average human psyche. “When a great person is having a less-than great time of things, it’s incredibly easy to sneak a few smug little digs at that person while  seemingly professing concern for their well-being. I believe the technical term for this is ‘being a total waste of flesh’.[1][1] Unable to compete fairly, they find a puerile joy in kicking someone while they’re down.”

We here at CANS may occasionally make fun of Steve Jobs, but we hope it’s still obvious that we have a lot of respect for the man and the company he’s created. We would like to again publicly thank Steve for all he’s done to make our world a better place and wish him a speedy recovery.
