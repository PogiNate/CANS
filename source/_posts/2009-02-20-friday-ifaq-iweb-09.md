Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we continue the iLife ’09 Odyssey with iWeb ’09, Apple’s latest foray into writing webpages for you.

Q: So, I noticed that iWeb now lets you publish to any FTP site, instead of just to Mobile Me. How do you think this will affect their visibility in the marketplace?

A: You know what needs more visibility in the marketplace? [Off-Road Velociraptor Safari][1], that’s what! 

 [1]: http://raptorsafari.com

Q: What?

A: That’s right! It’s a web game where you are a velociraptor driving a jeep around in the past…

Q: What?

A: …and get points for running down other velociraptors! 

Q: What about people using iWeb to create online photo galleries?

A: They can play too. And after you have run down a raptor you have this giant glowing ball thingy that comes out of the back of your jeep that you use to pick up the velociraptors and “export” them to the future, because they’re delicious!

Q: Is this some kind of odd metaphor for iWeb’s new export feature?

A: Stop changing the subject. You also get points for doing damage to your jeep, doing stunts like jumping really far, or going on two wheels, and stuff like that. But mostly it’s about the slow motion shots of a raptor bouncing off the hood of a safari vehicle at 75 mph.

Q: I hear iWeb pages look really good in Safari…

A: Yeah, yeah, iWeb is totally standards compliant and stuff. Listen, one time when I was playing, I was on top of a cliff, and there were three raptors on the edge. So I gunned it and turned sharp at the last second. I hit all three and knocked them off the cliff at the same time!

Q: Didn’t you fall off too?

A: Yeah, but you get points for that. So anyway, I then picked up one of the raptors and used it to knock over four others. It was awesome!

Q: I’ll take your word for it.

A: And the game is written using the Unity game engine, which means it has far better 3D graphics than a flash game, and it uses realistic physics to emulate collisions, falling, and all that good stuff.

Q: How much do we really know about raptor physics? 

A: I can’t answer that. I have to go try to export 20 raptors in five minutes. Bye.

Q: So, I’ll just finish up here then, shall I? Well folks, if you want a personal website, but don’t like writing websites, use iWeb. 100% raptor-free!
