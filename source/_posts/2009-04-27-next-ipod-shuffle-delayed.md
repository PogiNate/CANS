The launch of the newest iPod Shuffle-initially slated for this September-may be delayed, if the following transcript from the boardroom at One Infinite Loop is correct.

[Phil Schiller enters the boardroom. Peter Oppenheimer is already there, looking under tables, chairs, in cabinets, etc.]

Phil: Hey, Pete. Whatcha doin’, eh?[1][1]

Peter: Phil! Hi! Oh, nothing, nothing. Just um..[looks in three or four drawers]…looking. For. For…something.

Phil: Oh? What is it, maybe I can help.

Peter: It’s nothing, I’m sure I’ll find it. Don’t trouble yourself. I’m sure you’ve got a lot of…marketing to oversee, or something, I wouldn’t want to trouble you.

Phil: Ah, I can use a break. Seriously, what’s got you so worked up?

Peter: Well, It’s… see, Jony loaned me the latest prototype of the next iPod Shuffle, and, well, I think I set it down in here somewhere.

Phil: Wow! Jony’s gonna be livid if he found out you lost it, huh?

Peter: I know! That’s the problem! I gotta get it back before he asks about it.

[Jony Ive pokes his head around the door]

Jony: Pete, I told Tim and Steve that you were testing out the new Shuffle for me. They’re really excited. So give it a good test, make sure it’s exactly what we wanted, okay?

Peter: O-okay, Jony, no problem! It’s really great! I’m sure they’ll love it.

Jony: Okay then. Well, see ya later. I gotta go get back to work on the new MacPad. Really, you think someone in marketing could have come up with a better name for a revolutionary tablet device [continues talking as he leaves the room and walks down the hall]

Phil: Ooooooh boy! That was close for you! 

Peter: I know, I know! Stop talking and help me find it before Tim comes asking about it, okay?

Phil: Okay, okay! What’s it look like?

Peter: That’s the thing, it looks like a regular pair of iPod headphones.

Phil: What? 

Peter: Yeah, see, that’s the big surprise. Jony and Papermaster and them managed to build an entire iPod into the little volume control thingy on the headphone cable. You can plug your shuffle into any other device, or you just listen to it by itself.

Phil: So, you left a prototype of a brand new iPod that looks like a pair of headphones on a desk… oooh, you’re dead, Pete.

Peter: Shut up, Phil! 

Phil: I mean, good thing *white earbuds* are so rare, all we have to do is find someone with a pair and we got it, right?

Peter: Shut *up*, Phil!

Phil: Hey, hey, when you get fired, can I have that really cool chair you got at the Christmas party last year?

Peter: I’m not gonna get fired, Phil. Just help me find the prototype and everything will be fine. Okay, so, besides you, me, and Jony, who else has been in this room today?

Phil: I don’t know! It’s not like I keep track of everyone who comes in and out of the conference room. Anyone could have been here. Delivery people, secretaries, that cleaner guy…

Peter: Wait, you mean that new guy? the one who looks like Basil Rathbone after a hard night?

Phil: Yeah…

Peter: The one who looks like he’d take anything not nailed down?

Phil: I guess so…

Peter: The one who *stole* the prototype of the new iPod Shuffle, possibly with plans to *sell it to Microsoft*?

Phil: Yeeeeaaaah, yeah, he does kinda look like a spy, doesn’t he? Kinda shifty lookin’, huh?

Peter: How are your marketing skills these days, Phil? Pretty persuasive?

Phil: Just call me the carpenter, Pete, ’cause I’m gonna do me some framing. But it’s gonna cost ya.

Peter: What? Whaddya mean?

Phil: I want that chair you got for the Christmas Party last year.

Peter: You drive a hard bargain, Phil. It’s yours.

Phil: The carpenter is on the job!
