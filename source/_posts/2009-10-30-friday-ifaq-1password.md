Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we cover the one and only [1Password][1], for all your storing-secret-stuff needs!

A: What’s the big deal? I already use one password!

Q: The program “1Password”?

A: No, I mean I have one password that I use for everything everywhere. Wanna know what it is?

Q: NO! That’s just stupid! Why even ask?

A: It’s “kittenzcanhasfood”! It’s super secure because it’s long and has a “z” instead of an “s” in there!

Q: And it’s on the internet! That has “secure password” all over it!

A: Aaaah, what’s the big deal? So the five people who read this site will know my password, so what? I don’t even really exist.

Q: True, but if you did, suddenly all your everything would be vulerable to…let me see here… *anybody on earth*. If you want to be that exposed on the web why not just take the plunge and run Windows Vista? And it’s more like 20 people, thank you very much.

A: I still don’t see how a program is going to help me be “safer” on the web. I mean, I still just have one password, it just stores it a bunch of times.

Q: Or you can let it create new passwords for you, which are random and secure, and let it fill those in for you.

A: So anyone can walk up to my computer and use all my stored 1Password passwords. Great. MUCH better than what I’m doing now.

Q: No, they would have to know your “1Password” that you use to sign in to 1Password, otherwise it won’t fill in squat.

A: Okay, so it fills in passwords on one computer…

Q: All your Macs…

A: What now?

Q: 1Password can synchronize your stored passwords to all your macs. And your stored software serial numbers. And your stored…whatever. It specializes in those areas, though. Oh, and it can sync with your iPhone/iPod Touch.

A: Well that’s just spiffy. So what can’t it do?

Q: Make this post funny.
