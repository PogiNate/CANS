Tens of thousands of people are seriously thinking about calling in sick today with hurt feelings as the MacHeist-spawned gang wars rage across the internet.

“This one guy said that my team wasn’t cool! That’s not nice!”, said ElBanditoCaptain652542, which is a name I hope I made up just now. “I don’t even know why I’m on my team. Or what that means. Or anything. Now I’m too sad to go to work.”

Indeed, despite the fact that the individual points and team rankings are determined by a system so opaque that even Apple would be proud of it, people are still using their newly-found colors to boost their egos at the expense of others.

“Orange Team! Kicking the buts [sic] of all teh [sic] other colorz [sick]” posted reMonkey4335453223344. His post was followed by similarly coherent statements from members of all the other teams.

Surprisingly enough, we were able to contact the secretive “directorate” and get a quote from them.[1][1]

“Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha \*GAAAAAASP\* hahahahahahahaha!” Said Phill Ryu, While John Casasanta mixed things up a little with a “Bwa ha ha! Heh heh, hehehe, HA HA HA HA HAAAAH! haha.” 

We here at CANS would like to thank MacHeist for creating a situation of which even [William Golding][2] would be proud.

Apple was too bewildered to comment.
