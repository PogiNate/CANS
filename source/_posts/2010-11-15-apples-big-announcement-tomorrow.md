So, Apple has spammed the iTunes store with “We’re about to do something amazing” type banners, and nobody knows what’s actually coming. Not [John Gruber][1], not [Andy Ihnatko][2], not even me. I can’t tell you how happy this makes me. In these days when all corporate secrets are leaked/rumored/left in bars it’s nice to have something come up that actually catches people flatfooted. All the respected technology pundits are stumped, and it’s refreshing and kinda fun.[1][3]

However, unlike the aforementioned respected technology pundits, I have no reputation for veracity and can therefore speculate like crazy. And since I’m slightly ahead of the curve on my [NaNoWriMo ][4]story, I figured I can spend some time making things up in this world instead of my novel world. These, then, are my terrible guesses about tomorrow’s announcement.

*   **Angry Birds for Mac**. People will be quick to point out that the Mac is already capable of playing Angry Birds and listening to Pandora at the same time, which gives it a significant advantage over the iPad. Right-minded people will continue to wonder why these two apps continue to be the yardstick against which all new OS/hardware combos are measured.
*   **iOS 5.0 **“We’re just gonna launch it, and the developers can catch up when they do.” An insanely-pleased-with-himself Steve Jobs will announce.
*   **Apple buys Oracle**. “THIS is why we’re not making our own Java any more. We just BOUGHT Java! And Solaris. And MySQL. Oh yeah, and that Oracle and PeopleSoft garbage. We’ll EOL those shortly. But hey, what do you all think about ‘iDatabase’ as the new name for MySQL?”[2][5]
*   **New iPod Nanos that are actually good again**. “We’re renaming the old ones “ShuffleTouches”, which sounds kinda racy but actually isn’t,” Phil Schiller will explain.
*   **Free Upgrade to Lion for everyone!**[3][6] . Apple will get people warmed up for the Mac App Store by making Lion a free upgrade in the current iTunes store. Critics will have a hard time deciding if this is an example of incredible generosity or a cynical way to line up all Apple users like sheep for the shearing as they start to buy all their software via Apple.
*   **Peter Oppenheimer Will Finally Finish Portal**: Apple’s CFO will finish the iconic first-person-puzzle-shooter on stage and broadcast live via iTunes. “This is a triumph!” Steve Jobs will say. Jonathan Coulton and Natalie Imbruglia[4][7] will then come out on stage and sing an acoustic version of the closing credits song. Everyone who watches the broadcast will have “[Still Alive][8]” stuck in their heads for weeks. *Again*.
*   **Apple buys Oracle *and *Sweden**. These two acquisitions will be mentioned in passing. The rest of the announcement will be 45 minutes of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive showing off their cool houses they made in [Minecraft][9]. Notch[5][10] will be named “A National Treasure” and will eventually have to get a restraining order against Jerry Bruckheimer and Nicholas Cage so they will stop trying to steal him from his office.

Well, we could go on, but we’re mild and modest[6][11] and don’t want to look *too *prescient in public. Feel free to put on your tinfoil hat and guess what Apple is up to in the comments.
