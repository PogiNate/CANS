Some rejected drafts:

*Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, ‘cept me, with my mouse.  
The comments were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of free software danced in their heads.[1][1]

 [1]: #footnote_0_284 "coincidentally, I once tried to write a Linux version of this when I was a huge Open Source geek.  It didn’t get much farther than this."

*And Moltz in his kerchief, and Pogue in his cap, had just settled their brains for a long winter’s nap*

*[something about Steve Jobs in a sleigh.]

No.

## Santa’s iPhone:

News today of an unexpected user of the iPhone’s GPS technology has deeply disheartened the Android mob, which is a bunch of robots anyway, so what are they even doing with hearts in the first place?  
“I just like how easy it is to use,” said Saint Nick, in a phone interview December 23. “I put in the kids’ names and their addresses are pulled up on the map, and I can see how close I am to them. I mean, I’m sure the G1 is nice and all, but this is where it’s at.”

Huh-uh.

## Christmas in the Apple Boardroom

**Steve**: C’mon, Phil, what’s wrong?  
**Phil**: I’m afraid all the zealots will be mean to me. I can never be as insanely great as you, Steve.  
**Steve**: That’s true. But you can still think different! And your difference can never be copied by anyone else. In fact, the other directors and I have written a little song to help you out! Ready guys?  
**Directors**:* [Half-hearted mumbling, someone says, "can't I go home to my family yet?"]*  
**Steve**: Great! Hit it, Al!

Nope.

Deep in the Matrix-colored recesses of his Ballmer-Cave, the virus creator has brought forth his most devious weapon yet: a *malicious Excel Macro*! Unfortunately, it only works on PC’s with no antivirus running windows 98 or older. But it’s a step.

Ugh.

Okay, I got nothin’.  Whatever holiday you celebrate this time of year, even if it’s only a few days off work, I hope  you have a happy one and wish you an insanely great[2][2]  new year.
