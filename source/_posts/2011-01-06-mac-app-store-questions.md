We’re not really ready to post a full on iFAQ about the Mac App Store, because we haven’t upgraded to 10.6.6 yet. So we’re going to ask pointed questions in an effort to stir up pointless controversy. Mostly because it sounds like fun.

*   Is it true that the App Store will be giving a percentage of every purchase to the DEVIL?
*   What if I want to offer a free trial version of my app? 
    *   What do you mean that iOS developers already do that just fine?
*   Does the app store represent the end of the free market?
*   Will all my base belong to Apple? 
    *   Is it too early to hop on the retro “All your base” wagon?
*   What happens if Apple discovers they secretly hate an App after they said they liked it? Will it disappear off my mac?
*   Is there anything in the app store, either by intent or by accident, that will make it easier for John Mayer to invade my computer? 
    *   Norah Jones is fine.
*   Fun bonus question: Come up with the best name for Microsoft’s copycat App store that will probably be announced either at CES or later this year! 
    *   Our guess: Windows Live Program Marketplace 8.

That’s all we have for today. Expect a really nice iFAQ tomorrow after we’ve had some time to play with the dang thing. Well, actually don’t. Whenever we promise a post bad things happen to it before we actually get it posted. So seek to manage your expectations accordingly. We’ll keep you posted.
