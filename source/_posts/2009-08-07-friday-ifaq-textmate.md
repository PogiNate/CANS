Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: TextMate, the emacs of the GUI world

Q: That was a terrible analogy, you know.

A: It’s valid: emacs is practically an OS in its own right, and TextMate is basically the entire Ruby programming language masquerading as a text editor.

Q: That doesn’t make it good. [Godwin’s law][1] may be valid, but that doesn’t make me less inclined to smack people who mention it upside the head.

A: You’re awfully opinionated for a “Q:”, you know.

Q: Well, you got my back up. I mean, what do you want? You say that my beloved baby TextMate isn’t as awesome as some crufty ol’ emacs, and expect me to be happy about it?

A: Ummm… Can I speak frankly for a moment?

Q: I’m the “Q:” around here! Stop asking me questions!

A: Fine. You ask some.

Q: …Alright. What were you going to say? But it can’t be a question!

A: Okay…um…, okay here goes: I’ve noticed and often wondered about the odd [relationships][2] [web designers][3] [seem to form][4] [with their text editors][5]. Indeed, I have often wondered why this seems to happen so often to web designers in particular.

Q: So you suspect that web developers are strangely–

A: Perhaps unnaturally–

Q: Attached to their plain-text-with-syntax-higlights programs, is that it?

A: Yes.

Q: Because you totally aren’t a web programmer at all.

A: Right.

Q: And you could happily use any text editor under the sun, up to and including notepad.exe.

A: ….

Q: Right?

A: …. …..

Q: *Riiiight*?

A: ….Gaaaaaah! No! Not notepad! IneedmyOSXandTextMateorBBEditorevenKomodoifIhavetoworkonWindowsorLinuxpleasedon’tmakemeusenotepadpleasepleaseplease…

Q: Uh huh.

A: \*pant\* \*pant\* \*pant\*

Q: There there. Now, doesn’t that feel better? 

A: A…A little.

Q: Good. Now maybe we can deal with the other problem.

A: What other problem?

Q: Having too many plain-text-with-syntax-highlighting text editors.
