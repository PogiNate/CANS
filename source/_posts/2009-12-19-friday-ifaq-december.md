Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products. 

This week we’re departing from our usual fare and offering you some tips for using the month of December to your advantage as a Mac user.

Q: So, this is what the top of a shark looks like…

A: Quiet, you.

Q: All right, I’ll bite[1][1] –

A: Hey! Only I get to write footnotes!

Q: –Ignoring that… Okay, so, what sage advice do you offer as proof that you aren’t just wasting time and space with this article?

A: There are many unique opportunities in December for Mac Users! Lots of App bundles come up about this time every year, and there’s the sales on hardware, and hard drives, and hard games…

Q: So, you want us Mac users to take full advantage of…low low prices all across the internet?

A: Well, it’s also a time for bragging. I mean, let’s say you’ve got a family member who sends out a holiday dvd full of pictures of their kids in various activities all year, and then expects a nice, complimentary email praising their skill and my how little Jennifer has grown, hasn’t she? Well, as a Mac user, you can totally show them up by using iMovie to make your own holiday video, then host it on Mobile me, along with all your pictures and a thoughtfully-written blog. Then you can send a beautifully-themed email from Mail using one of Apple’s “stationary” options letting everyone know that your magnum opus is online, and they may view it at their convenience.

Q: So, we should take advantage of low, low prices AND use our Macs to make ourselves appear far superior to our PC-using relatives?

A: Well, yeah. I mean, isn’t that pretty much why you bought a Mac in the first place?

Q: Granted, but it doesn’t seem like that should have to wait until December. 

A: It’s true. You should carry the spirit of Mac Superiority with you all the year round!

Q: I will! I will remember to use Mail and iMovie to look better than others! I will buy Apple’s OS upgrades and their new versions of iWork and iLife! I will keep the spirit of Mac Superiority in my heart, all the year!

A: Steve Jobs bless us, every one!
