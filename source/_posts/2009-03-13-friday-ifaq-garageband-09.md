Q: I broke my arm. When I get my cast off, will I be able to play the piano?

Q: …You’re no fun.

A: Sorry. So, I’m guessing you’re excited about the Artist Lessons in GarageBand, right?

Q: Oh yeah. It’s like having Sting right in my house!

Q: I mean, who doesn’t want to play Roxanne?

A: Please, if you have any decency, stop now!

Q: –John Meyer! 

John Meyer: Hello everyone! Did I hear someone say they wanted to learn how I crafted that amazing chord progression for “Your Body Is A Wonderland”?

A: AAAAAARGH! See what you’ve done? 

JM: By creating a monotonous, nearly *boring* chord structure, I was able to emphasize the imperturbable nature of my protagonist…

Q: Ha ha, yeah! That’s what I’m talking about! Bore me, John! bore me like a comatose lizard!

JM: And my emphasizing the change from one “line” to the next I was hinting that…

A: Thaaaat’s it! I’m out. C’mon, readers. Let’s go.
