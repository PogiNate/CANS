Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week we look at Apple’s favorite way to sell you more stuff: The Mac App Store!

Q: I see what they did there.

A: Not sure that counts as a question.

Q: No, see, everyone was all, “Maybe they’ll do what they did with iOS 4 and make it free because of the whole ‘look, now we can sell you stuff!’ angle, but now that the App Store isn’t part of Lion they can go back to charging for Lion.

A: How delightfully cynical. I’m sure it has nothing to do with making the Mac easier for people to use right here right now. And the whole “promoting the work of OSX developers” angle is completely bogus as well, right?

Q: Gotcha! You asked the first question. I win. Anyway, you’re fooling yourself. Apple likes OSX developers, but they like them even more now that they can make 30% of every sale. And they’ll like everyone better when they pay $40-$100 for Lion in a few months.

A: So, you’re one of the masses who are surprised that Apple, Inc. is a business and is actually into making some money once in a while.

Q: Hey, if  they want to make a few billion dollars here and there more power to ‘em say I. But I’m not part of the “Apple is doing it all for us” crowd either.

A: So, politics aside, did you have any questions about the actual App Store?

Q: What’s to ask? If you’ve used an iOS device you can figure it out. There’s some pretty animations hopping icons into your dock, and it’s nice that your software follows you around without you remembering to put all your serial numbers in to 1Password–

A: I love 1Password, by the way.

Q: Who doesn’t? It’s freakin’ awesome. But, again, not the point. The point is that Apple has, as they are wont to do, made the actual software dead simple. But behind the clean, simple interface lay a murky quagmire of politics and avarice.

A: In America[1][1] we call it “capitalism”. People trade money for things they perceive as valuable.

Q: So where’s the value in the App Store for the consumer? What is the developer getting for 30% of their profits?

A: The consumer gets auto-upgrades and no more concerns about their licenses, the developer gets to not worry about credit card processing or order management, as well as a built-in advertising channel.

Q: You’re kinda quashing the humor here.

A: Yeah, we sound like a financial program.

Q: Er…Steve Ballmer?

A: Phil Schiller?

Q: Nah, it doesn’t work. Humor really is all about context.

A: Oh well. We got an iFAQ written, even with all the portents of doom we were casting around yesterday.[2][2]

Q: I guess that counts for something.
