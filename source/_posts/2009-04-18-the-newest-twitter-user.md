Much has been said about Oprah “officially” deciding to use Twitter, thus ushering in the end of the microblogging platform as a trendy thing that many people use and the beginning of the microblogging platform as a pure advertising vehicle.  However, very little has been said–perhaps appropriately– about Harpo joining the Twitter family.

“Twitter is perfectly suited for Harpo’s unique brand of communication,” said his agent on Monday. “After all, in all his movies, he never even spoke so much as a single word, so 140 characters is a luxury.”

And indeed, most of Harpo’s posts are spartan in nature. Consider the following example:

    @Groucho: [Honks horn twice] @Chico: [shakes fist]

[1][1]  
And this one:

 [1]: #footnote_0_415 "Groucho’s response: @Harpo: Oh, so that's how you feel about it. If you'd told me before I wouldn't have asked.  Chico’s response: @Harpo: Whatsa matter for you, eh, Pinky? I getta you a job, and thisa how you treat me? "

    @Margaret_Dumont: [leers, then chases around pool]

It’s also not a coincidence that Harpo is “following” @Margaret_Dumont, @LillyRoth, and @BathingBeauties

Not surprisingly, the musical star has remained silent on Oprah’s use of Twitter, and on the topic of her blatant theft of his stage name. [2][2]
