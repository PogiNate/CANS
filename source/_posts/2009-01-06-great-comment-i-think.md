The following is a translation[1][1] of a comment that was in my spam queue:

> It compliments for idea of the site. Also we are lovers of the trekking. Why we don’t organize an encounter of gotten passionate for of the excursions together? Even not more than 6-8 in all? A salute. 

I think it works out to a compliment. Or an invitation to a crazy fling in Italy[2][2] with, er, 6-8 trekkies. Either way, It’s at least kinda complimentary. And kinda creepy.

 [2]: #footnote_1_296 "the comment was originally in Italian."
