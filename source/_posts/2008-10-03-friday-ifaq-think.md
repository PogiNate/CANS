Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

Today, in honor of Freeverse giving discounts on things to people who know things, we decided to give you the heads up on one of their least expensive applications: [Think][1]. Freeverse was kind enough to let us route our questions to [Grug][2], the IT orc!

Q: Does Think really make anyone more productive?

A: Not Grug, that for sure.

Q: Why is that?

A: Grug constantly switching windows: now read Slashdog, now read Armor Technica, now back to playing Hordes of Humans, Grug needs to be able to do it all.

Q: So… you don’t support your own company’s product?

A: Oh, Think fine.  Good for redhead girl. Monkey likes it too.  But Grug gotta be free.

Q: So, Think boxes you in, huh?

A: Look, Grug not need focus on one project to be productive. Grug *hyperthreaded*!

Q: You implement an outdated Intel technology?

A: Okay, okay, Grug written in C , so Grug just threaded, but hyperthreaded sound cooler.

Q: So, you can focus on many things at once, and Think just makes that harder for you.

A: That about right.  Sometimes, Grug take call, write iFAQ, and beat Luna at Checkers all at same time. How screen backdrop help me there?

Q: You’re not really selling me on the product here.

A: Why bother? Think free. You like, you use. You don’t like, no big deal.

Q: Well, that clears that up. One more question?

A: Shoot. Hahaha.

Q: What’s the best way to go: Fire, Ice, or Lightning?

A: Radiation.
