Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: Everyone’s favorite media player’s newest incarnation: iTunes 9!

Q: I have a question about “Genius Mixes”; Why does my “Rock Mix 2″ play some tracks over and over?

A: That’s a good question. But you know what a better question would be?

Q: Ummm…

A: Something more like, “hey, where did you get that absolutely *beautiful* MacBook Pro?”

Q: So, did you get a MacBook Pro?

A: Or an even better question would be, “Hey, did you win some sort of major award at your place of employment, and then use part of the proceeds of that major award to purchase an absolutely *stunning* 15″ MacBook Pro?”

Q: I’m not even going to try to remember all that. Look, are you going to answer my question or what?

A: I don’t know what your problem is. iTunes works fine on my brand new MacBook Pro.

Q: Really?

A: Yes!… Maybe. I don’t actually have any music on there yet. But I plan to use home sharing later to pull a bunch of my music off of my iMac onto my new–

Q: –MacBook Pro. Yes, got it. So really, you don’t know what’s going on at all, as far as iTunes 9 is concerned, huh?

A: Well, I installed it on my iMac and my old MacBook, but I haven’t really had all that much time to play with it. I was too busy being named one of the six best employees IN THE WORLD!!!

Q: Really?

A: Maybe, or maybe it was more “one of the six recipients of an award given out by a fairly large UNIVERSITY that’s in the state OF UTAH“. 

Q: You’re a bit useless this week,you know that?

A: Do you know how many days I’ve worked this week? 1.5![1][1]

Q: You are a paragon of employeeship. Okay, maybe you’ll be in the mood to actually answer questions next week. Have fun with your new toy.

A: Wait, what? I was too busy turning the lights off and watching my keyboard light up.

Q: My point exactly.
