Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.

This week: yet another great way to resize movies you own onto your iPod: DVD Remaster Pro!

Q: Can I steal movies with this program?

A: NO.[1][1]

 [1]: #footnote_0_417 "yes"

Q: So, it’s got some kinda super-intelligent Apple-powered “I only make legal copies” thing goin’ on? 

A: YES.[2][2]

 [2]: #footnote_1_417 "no"

Q: Wow. This is kinda refreshing. So, if Tim Cook says that Apple “Isn’t making a netbook”, but that they’re “watching [that] space”, does this essentially mean that the Mac Tablet is a certainty?

A: BETTER NOT TELL YOU NOW.[3][3]

 [3]: #footnote_2_417 "probably"

Q: So, was Steve Jobs just being a whiny baby when he said that he didn’t feel that Apple was appreciating him enough in connection with that stock option mess?

A: MY SOURCES SAY NO.[4][4]

 [4]: #footnote_3_417 "That’s a tough question.  I’m sure he was feeling under-appreciated; I mean, he saved the company. But still, it could have been a cover-up for some shady deals. It’s hard to tell, exactly."

Q: Does Oprah’s adoption of Twitter signify the death of that microblogging platform? And if so, what’s next, a blog where you can only write one word at a time?

A: CONCENTRATE AND ASK AGAIN[5][5]

 [5]: #footnote_4_417 "That’s two questions.  Our first answer: who knows? but the “cool geeks” are going to move on, that’s for sure.  As for your second question, we dont’ think that a shorter limit is what’s going to define the next small thing.  It’s gotta be cool and easy. How it’s used is anybody’s guess."

Q: Did you think that my previous question had anything to do with the Mac or the iPhone?

A: OUTLOOK GOOD[6][6]

 [6]: #footnote_5_417 "Actually, we hate Outlook.  But that’s just our little joke. While Twitter is not directly related to the Mac, the iPhone community and the Mac community have both been quick to jump on board the good ship Twitter, with David Pogue being just the most annoying example.  (How many puns does he need on his twitter stream?) So it’s related-ish."

Q: Do you think you’ll do another iFAQ like this?

A: YOU MAY RELY ON IT[7][7]
