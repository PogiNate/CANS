<p>It wasn’t too long ago that software bundles–collections of programs sold for far less than retail price–roamed this earth like big ol’ lizards or something. They dominated the landscape. As far as the eye could see, there were bundles of five, ten, even twenty apps, all brought to you in a shiny package, delivered with charm, class, style, and occasionally a bit of terrible faux-drama. </p>

<p>In these more urbane times we are left to mourn, to reminisce, and to shed but a single silent tear for those halcyon days.<a href="#footnote_0_976" title="November is National Novel Writing Month. I’m warming up. I’ll be writing on purple paper this year.">1</a></p>

<p>How did we come to this pass? What happened to the mighty, fighty software bundle? Whence the colossi, like the MacHeist, or the MacUpdate Bundle? Join us as CANS seeks to solve the mystery of the disappearing bundle.</p>

<p>“Three words for you: iOS,” says Perry Simm, whose mind, while forever voyaging, stopped long enough to talk to us. “Back in the day of desktops and laptops people bought ‘programs’ instead of ‘apps’. People bought them from all kinds of different vendors, instead of everything coming from Apple’s virtual warehouses. Bundles don’t work on the App Store, and people aren’t working on non-iOS apps anymore. The torch has been passed on.”</p>

<p>“The bundle was an weapon in the war between Mac and Windows. When the battlefront moved to the mobile space, it was like lobbing shells at unoccupied villages in France: fun for a while, but ultimately useless,” explained Ann Alogy, historian. We asked if she’d ever been told that her similes need work. “This isn’t the first time,” she responded.</p>

<p>As interesting as these interviews weren’t, we felt we needed to dig deeper, to go to the source, to utilize yet another exploration-based metaphor for actually talking to someone who actually knew what happened. So we did it: We made up a conversation with that <a href="http://www.macheist.com/static/about/Directorate/JohnCasasanta.jpg">guy with the huge red hair</a> that used to run <a href="http://www.macheist.com">MacHeist</a>. You know the one. John somebody.</p>

<p>We found him hanging out at the Helvetica Neue, a bistro/club for people with highly refined senses of graphic design. The club is airy and open, with birds flying gracefully between the understated ionic pillars that stand in neat rows, not actually supporting anything but the patrons’ sense of superiority over the common man. John was lounging on a triclinium, eating from a bento box resting on a table made of a single piece of aluminium.<br />
“The ‘Heist was fun when we were younger and times were wild. There was a certain youthful charm, a certain innocence in it. Also we were poor back then and had to actually do things for money.” he paused briefly to silently acknowledge Jonathan Ive as he walked past. “But now I seek greater refinement, greater sophistication and simplicity. While there was much to be gained from the ragged, rabid energy of MacHeist–experience with vendor relations, marketing, hundreds of thousands of dollars– I now seek enlightenment and phat cash through the creation and sale of simple iPhone apps.”</p>

<p>“Is there no hope for the bundles, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There is hope in moving on,” he answered, and turned back to his delicately seasoned rice and fish.</p>

<p>And there we stand. Well, not “there”, as in “still at the Helvetica Neue”, because they threw us out when we asked if they have root beer, but “there” as in “at that mental and emotional state” there. The hope of great new bundles dimmed, but a brighter, more expensive hope of greater software utility in the form of elegant little apps for iOS devices dawning o’er the purple east. We may never again see people with terrible faux-russian accents try to convince us that our actions will save Apple from the dread clutches of…someone<a href="#footnote_1_976" title="I never did figure out who the bad guy was supposed to be in that MacHeist">2</a> but we will be able to play Angry Birds. I only hope its enough.</p>
