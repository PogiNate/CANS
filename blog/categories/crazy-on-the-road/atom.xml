<p>Tired of snow, wind, rain, and all the related weather systems? So are we. That’s why we at CANS HQ are packing the whole shebang into one personal item and one carry-on item and flying to Orlando FL for a week.</p>

<p>The fact that our employer is paying us to go to some sort of conference thingy there doesn’t enter into it at all. We’re just going to see what kinds of uses alligators have for iPads, and if the iPhone 4 has invaded the magic kingdom. Although truthfully, unless someone other than our own illustrious selves unbelts for magic kingdom admission, we’ll probably stick to less-magical kingdoms and keep hold of our mundane but useful pictures of dead presidents.</p>

<p>Also, let us all hope that, at the end of the trip, I can say with absolute honesty “no hard drives were injured in the making of this week’s articles.” Unlike last time.</p>
