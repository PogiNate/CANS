<p>Every Friday<a href="#footnote_0_36" title="or Saturday, if we have network troubles on Friday">1</a> we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple User, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.<br/>
Today: Boot Camp.</p>

<p>Q: So, like, can I boot into a Linux partition using Boot Camp?<br/>
A: TEN-HUT! Would you care to rephrase that question, soldier?<br/>
Q: Er, can I boot into a Linux Partition using Boot Camp, Sir?<br/>
A: SIR? Do I look like a goshdarned officer to you? So you see these three stripes on my arm? Do you, maggot? While you are in this man’s boot camp you will call me Drill Sergeant! DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?<br/>
Q: YES DRILL SERGEANT<img src="#footnote_1_36" title="This article is going to have a lot of CAPS LOCK action going on. Sorry about that. " alt="2" /><br/>
A: Okay. Now, in this man’s boot camp we boot into exactly two operating systems. OSX, the home country, and Windows, or enemy territory. And you little taped-glasses pantywaist GEEKS want to start fighting on a third front! You want to attack our UNIX-based, penguin lovin’ allies in the middle of a war! Does that sound like a good idea to you, maggot?<br/>
Q: NO DRILL SERGEANT!<br/>
A: Fine. Now, this is how we do things around here: 1.) You obtain a valid Windows key! 2.) Use the Boot Camp Assistant to partition your disk! 3.)Install Windows in the newly created partition! ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?<br/>
Q: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN IRRESISTIBLE FORCE MEETS AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT, DRILL SERGEANT?<br/>
A: Oh, a wise guy. Mr. College here thinks he can outsmart the dumb ol’ Drill Sergeant. Thinks Sarge never learned anything about unanswerable hypothetical questions. Didn’t think to mention the destructability of the immovable object, which, being made of granite, in my hypothetical example, IS DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY!! IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO? NOW DROP AND GIVE ME 20!<br/>
Q: 1…2…3…4…5…<br/>
A: Now, carrying on.<br/>
Q: 6…7…8…9…10…<br/>
A: Once Windows is installed, you move back and forth between Operating systems by holding down the “option” key at boot time!<br/>
Q: 11…12…13…14…15…<br/>
A: You MUST use antivirus software, or it will be hosed just like any other Windows computer!<br/>
Q: 16…17…18…19…20, DRILL SERGEANT!<br/>
A: You MUST exercise caution when installing new applications! So, do you have any more smart-alek questions now, college?<br/>
Q: NO DRILL SERGEANT!<br/>
A: GOOD! Now, let’s all jog over to the mess hall and get our grub. Sound Off!<br/>
(all) <em>I don’t know but I’ve been told<br/>
Bill Gates is getting pretty old…</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>All around the world, people are already standing in line, hoping to be the first to use Mobile Me, Apple’s latest revision of its online storage and synchronization tools.</p>

<p>Which is odd, because they can just buy a .Mac membership and it will work when Mobile Me is launched possibly later tonight.  But still they line up at Apple stores across America, “waiting for the cloud”.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell if they’re serious,” said an Apple store employee, who asked to remain anonymous, which we don’t like because “anonymous” is really hard to spell the same way twice, so we’re going to call him Bob Johnson. “We asked if they were excited about the iPhone launch this Friday, and they’re all like ‘pssssh.  iPhone.  Just a jumped-up Treo!  We want our image galleries instantly synced up across all our computers.’  What was really weird is that they all said it in unison.”</p>

<p>But not everyone shares Bob’s trepidation.  Bob hoards his trepidation, keeping it locked away, safe within a strongbox deep in his soul.  To find out more, we went to one of the thousands of “Mobile Parties” that are happening across the country today, and spoke to one of the raving fans.</p>

<p>“I’m so excited! I just can’t hide it! I’m about to sync my email, and I think I like it!” blared the huge stack of speakers as we entered the high school gymnasium that a group in Des Moines, Iowa had rented.  Inside was a crowd of people, all wearing shirts with the Mobile Me logo, all dancing, singing, eating apple based snacks from long tables along one wall, or plugging their laptops into one of the many LAN-party style stations on the other wall.</p>

<p>“Yes, I too await the coming of Me,” said a man, who would only identify himself as “stevor338@me.com”.  “With the coming of Me we shall all finally be able to transcend the myth of physical forms, not to mention have our contacts available to us from any Mac or PC.  Yes, as we embrace the Me in the Cloud, the purely physical me, the one that doesn’t take stylish vacations to Cancun or Whistler, the one that doesn’t match Apple’s vision of humanity, will be left, a shell sitting in a chair in front of a late-model G5 iMac, while our spirits dance among the servers in Cupertino.”</p>

<p>And with that we left them, moved and impressed, not to mention creeped out.  Will the launch of Mobile Me truly herald the coming of Mankind’s truest self, our ultimate destiny, or will we simply have 20GB of storage space online in which we can keep our plans for a home made radio laser cannon?  Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple User, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>Today’s Feature: RSS</p>

<p>Q: It’s the 4th of July, and I live in America.  Is there a way I can make my screen saver on my Mac look like a whole bunch of cool fireworks?</p>

<p>A: Yes there is! The <a href="http://www.reallyslick.com/downloads.html"><strong>R</strong>eally <strong>S</strong>lick <strong>S</strong>creensavers</a> Project<a href="#footnote_0_34" title="You thought this was going to be all about news readers and stuff, didn’t you? Gotcha!">1</a>  has created a screen saver called Skyrocket.  When it starts, your screen looks like you’re flying around a field where a whole fireworks show is happening.</p>

<p>Q: That sounds cool! Does it allow you to control what kinds of fireworks get set off? I’ve always wanted to be in control of a fireworks show.</p>

<p>A: Yes it does! By pressing the number keys along the top row of your keyboard (and some of the letters on the second row) you are put in control of the show! You can figure out which keys have the coolest fireworks and send those up over and over and over.  And when you get tired of running things, just stop pushing keys and the built-in pyrotechnicians will take back over.</p>

<p>Q: Wow! How much do I have to pay for this miracle of modern awesomeness?</p>

<p>A: That’s the best part! It’s free!  Hoooray! Happy Independence Day! The kind without aliens or Will Smith!  Yaaay!   But there’s a downside.  The project hasn’t been updated for the Mac since 2004.  It still works, but don’t expect cutting-edge awesomeness.  Still, why does everything need to be new to be good?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah!  I like week-old doughnuts far better than fresh ones!</p>

<p>A: …O-Okay.  Yeah!  Old things are awesome!</p>

<p>Q: Yeah! I’m going to throw off the bonds of “common decency” and go cruise for widowed octogenarians at the nursing home! Happy Independence Day! (<em>Sound of running feet.</em>)(<strong>SLAM!</strong>)(<em>Sound of car tires peeling out</em>)</p>

<p>A: Um… Not exactly what I had in mind, but, er, yaay? And Screensavers? Um, have a nice fourth?</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-07-02T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 2<span>nd</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Our lab tests today have conclusively revealed the reason that Snow Leopard’s Font Book application is so small.</p>

<p>One of the main “features” of Apple’s nascent operating system is the reduced size of all the core OSX components.  Graphs have been bandied about showing size decreases of 80%.  Font Book, the ubiquitous “no-you-can’t-see-the-font-unless-you-click-on-it” program that allows nearly all Mac programs to slightly annoy consumers is one of those massively reduced programs, and we have disovered, in this case at any rate, how Apple did it.</p>

<p>The only font in Snow Leopard’s Font Book is Helvetica Neue.</p>

<p>“It was a tough decision,” remarked Jim Baxter, Apple’s SVP of fonts, while cleaning out his desk. “We had literally hundreds of fonts that have been clogging up OSX’s hard drives for nearly a decade, even though no one ever uses them.  I mean, when was the last time you used Bank Gothic? Or how about Bernard MT Condensed?  And those are just two choices from the “b” section!  Really, we feel that Helvetica Neue is the only choice needed in the future.  It’s light, professional, bright, and serious all at once.  Also Steve told me it was going to be what we go with.”</p>

<p>According to our lab tests, users will be able to install other fonts, but they are no longer included by default.  This mistakenly leads Adobe to believe that they will now be making thousands of sales of their professional fonts.  We didn’t have the heart to tell them about free font web sites.</p>

<p>Apple was unlikely to comment, all things considered.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple User, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>Today Wikipedia answers all your questions about Numbers: Apple’s amazing spreadsheet application.</p>

<p>Q: Is numbers better than Excel?</p>

<p>A: <em>This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disambiguation" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> page lists articles associated with the same title. If an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Numbers&amp;namespace=0" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Numbers&amp;namespace=0">internal link</a> led you here, you may wish to change the link to point directly to the intended article.</em></p>

<p>Q: I want to make a pivot-table type thing in Numbers. How do I do that?</p>

<p>A: A <strong>pivot table</strong> is a data summarization tool found in data visualization programs such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet" title="Spreadsheet">spreadsheets</a> (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel" title="Microsoft Excel">Microsoft Excel</a>). Among other functions, they can automatically sort, count, and total the data stored in one table or spreadsheet and create a second table displaying the summarized data.</p>

<p>Q: I would like to format every other column as a currency column. Is there an easy way to do that?</p>

<p>A: For advice on number formatting when editing Wikipedia articles, see Wikipedia: Manual of Style.</p>

<p>Q: For some reason, the 3D graphs in Numbers occasionally look very pixellated and jagged. How do I avoid that?</p>

<p>A: This article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.</p>

<p>Q: Are there any useful AppleScripts written to make Numbers more interactive with other programs?</p>

<p>A: <strong>This article requires authentication or verification by an expert.</strong></p>

<p>Q: This isn’t the most helpful iFAQ ever, you know that?</p>

<p>A: All or part of this article may be confusing or unclear.</p>

<p>Q: Are these iFAQs useful to anyone ever?</p>

<p>With the adoption of <a href="﻿http://www.sproutcore.com/">Sproutcore</a>, a new fancy Javascript framework, Apple has sent a message to competing “Let’s make the web look like a desktop” systems.</p>

<p>“Bite our already-bitten logo, open source hippie freaks!”  suggested Phil Shiller.  When reminded that both Flash and Silverlight were proprietary, he then cordially invited Adobe and Microsoft to “Bite our already-bitten logo, corporate fascist dictator punk zombie freaks!”</p>

<p>“We will be using Sproutcore as the basis of iPhone enabled web apps,” says Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone software.  When asked about support for other “Rich Internet” platforms like Flash, Forstall recommended that Flash developers “stick it up their CVS repository” and “get with the future, which belongs to Sproutcore”.</p>

<p>Apple watchers haven’t been able to get enough of putting the word Sproutcore into their articles over and over again, to the point where it has almost eclipsed “SDK 2.0.”</p>

<p>When asked for a comment, Apple encouraged us to “take a flying leap.”</p>

<p>Today’s installment: Office-type software questions answered by “Weird Al” Yankovic.</p>

<p>Q: Every once in a while I need to stop making sideshows and websites about my fashionable trips to Hawaii and do some actual work.  I guess I’ll need to edit spreadsheets and documents and things.  Should I just use Microsoft Office for the Mac?</p>

<p>A: (<em>to the tune of “The William Tell Overture”</em>) Office sucks, Office sucks, Office sucks sucks sucks, Office sucks Office sucks Office sucks sucks sucks. Office sucks sucks sucks, Office sucks Office sucks Office sucks sucks sucks. SUUUUUUCKS, Office sucks sucks sucks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>With a slew of new products like the iPhone 3G, Mobile Me, Snow Leopard, etc. on the horizon, people are more upset than ever with the performance of Leopard’s Time Machine backup software.</p>

<p>“What I want from a time machine is the ability to move around freely in time,” said Jason Patrick, who we’re pretty sure is a real person. “Instead all I get is a sissy versioning backup system with an incredibly cool spacey thing going on behind it.  Who needs that?  What I want is a way to be the first one in line for my new iPhone!  Useless! ”</p>

<p>And Mr. Patrick is not the only one.  There is a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/133415/2008/05/spotlight2506.html">growing feeling among the Apple community</a> that they aren’t being given what they deserve as loyal fanatics of the world’s most advanced operating system, and that their blind faith in the company is being unscrupulously manipulated.</p>

<p>“I’ve been unscrupulously manipulated!” claimed Douglas Fairbanks of Fairbanks, Alaska. “When Apple tells me that they’ve created a time machine, I don’t go around asking questions and trying to know things.  I don’t want a lot of backtalk and lawyer-speak about how it can only recover files from the past.  I expect Apple to produce a full-on H.G. Wells style device for traveling willy-nilly through the time stream! How does Apple expect me to wait a full 45 days for Mobile Me? Whassat?  Yeah, I know that today’s the 18th and it comes out on the 11th, but I’ve been waiting in the past as well.”</p>

<p>Some feel the problem stems from the hype created when Apple CEO Steve Jobs does one of his famous keynote presentations.</p>

<p>“Steve Jobs creates in Apple followers an immense desire to immediately purchase the products he presents, lest they incur his wrath and are damned from the Infinite Loop forever,” says <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>.  “When he then tells them that they have to wait, that they must return to the mortal coil iPhone-3G-less, and with not even a Snow Leopard to comfort them, they get a bit testy. Then they get angry, then remorseful.  They reason that the fault belongs to their external backup device, and not with their almost infantile desire for immediate gratification.  Fortunately, I get preview copies of things, because I’m an incredibly successful ‘new journalist’. Yeah! How’s that taste, punks?  I write a blog and get a preview iPhone! What’d you get for your blog? A freshly baked batch of ‘you suck’ with sprinkles, that’s what!”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann</a>, however, believes that Apple’s lack of future-powered Time Machines is a design feature.  “If you could simply go to when you already had things done there would be no need for “Getting Things Done”, which would nullify the need for GTD software, mantras, filing systems and ultimately lead to chaos.  Apple is aware of this and has bravely withheld their powers that humanity may survive.  But I get preview units too, so I really don’t care.”</p>

<p>Up to this point in time, Apple has refused to comment.  What the future holds is as yet undetermined.</p>

<p>Firefox 3, the latest version of Mozilla’s legendary open source browser, is the first of the ‘Fox dynasty to make peace with OSX.</p>

<p>For years Firefox on the Mac has been ugly, ugly like a duck covered in oil and thrown off the back of a truck into a pile of herring innards that have been sitting by the side of the road from the toxic-waste-spewing EEA violators.  But now, all is sweetness and light.   Firefox has beautiful cocoa widgets and a new theme that looks so Leopard-y that Safari is kinda jealous.</p>

<p>Safari, meanwhile, is promising that good things are coming “real soon now™ ”, while the ‘Fox is running around the world like a marathon runner with a jet pack.  No, two jet packs, a transporter, and, like, a freakin’ laser cannon.  Rumors of the download site being down all morning on the big day are completely untrue and were made up by Hillary Clinton to ruin Firefox’s reputation.  Firefox is awesome.</p>

<p>Out-positive that, Walt Mossberg.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple User, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>Today’s edition: the new iPhone 3G.</p>

<p>Q: I’ve heard the new iPhone can integrate its GPS feature with Google Maps. How does that work?</p>

<p>A: It works <em>beautifully</em>.</p>

<p>Q: I was glad to see that Apple switched from the mirror-gloss case to a more sensible black plastic.  How does the new case hold up to scratches?</p>

<p>A: It is <em>exceptionally</em> designed. Beauty and functionality, all in one package.</p>

<p>Q: How does the iPhone decide if it’s going to use Wi-fi or 3G wireless access for data transfers?</p>

<p>A: The iPhone is a miracle of high technology.  Its what-service-should-I-use software is more intelligent than most graduate students.</p>

<p>Q: You haven’t really answered any of my questions, you realize that?  All you’ve done is spew platitudes.</p>

<p>A: The iPhone does not need to stand up to the questions of a mere anonymous <em>user</em>.  The iPhone is intuitive, elegant, and far better than you, or anyone you know, could ever be. Do not question the iPhone 3G, embrace it.  Welcome it into your life and you will see what you have been missing in your communication device.</p>

<p>Q: Once again, less than helpful.  </p>

<p>A: As you learn to accept the iPhone, your problems and questions will fall away, and you will become part of the Apple vision.  Soon you will see the glory in paying $70 a month to own an iPhone, and only then will you see the true, transcendent beauty of the iPhone.  </p>

<p>Q: Now I don’t know if I should be buying an iPhone or praying to it.</p>

<p>A: Cast aside your belief that there is a difference.</p>

<p>Q: Ooooookay, creeped out now.  I’m leaving.</p>

<p>A: Yes, now you are creeped out, but on July 11th, you will see the true light of Apple wisdom.  Don’t fight it. Accept the iPhone and break forth into joy.</p>
