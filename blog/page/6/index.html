<p>With Apple’s official <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/10/13/apple-holding-back-to-the-mac-event-on-october-20/">announcement </a>that they *do *remember how to make desktop operating systems the gate has been opened for rampant speculation. We here at CANS have never been above such things, and we see no reason to pretend we are now. Here, then, is our feature list for what looks to be OSX 10.7 “Lion”<a href="#footnote_0_978" title="Might not actually be called “Lion”, but come on. Look at the freakin’ picture. What else are they gonna call it?">1</a> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple finally breaks down and puts Blu-Ray into the Mac. Yeah, that’s too crazy even for us.</li>
  <li>Five, count ‘em *five *new wallpapers!</li>
  <li>Building on the success of the iOS ecosystem, Apple will limit you to seven screens’ worth of apps on your Mac. “How many word processors do you actually need? Steve Jobs will explain.<a href="#footnote_1_978" title="Steve Jobs is perfectly capable of explaining in the form of a question.">2</a></li>
  <li>Apple will announce a new MacBook Air. It will have a touch screen and a detachable keyboard. Critics who point out that it looks a lot like an iPad and keyboard set bundled into one box will never be heard from again.</li>
  <li>Lion will have a new 3D interface that utilizes a living room motif. The Sign-in screen will be the front door, your office apps would be on a desk, your games on a shelf, your movies in an entertainment center, etc. It’ll be high-tech and awesome and everyone will love it. Critics who point out that it’s just an updated version of <a href="http://www.bentuser.com/article.aspx?ID=327&amp;page=2">Microsoft Bob</a> will never be heard from again.</li>
  <li>Apple will stop supporting Adobe Flash on the desktop. “Oh, we have the technology,” Jony Ive will say. “We just like to tweak Adobe every now and again. Besides, who even needs Flash, now that<a href="http://homestarrunner.com/"> Homestar Runner</a> isn’t updating any more?”</li>
</ul>

<p>The possibilities are endless<a href="#footnote_2_978" title="I’m guessing; I could apparently only think of six.">3</a> ! Have a guess? Shout it out loud and proud in the comments.</p>

<p>It wasn’t too long ago that software bundles–collections of programs sold for far less than retail price–roamed this earth like big ol’ lizards or something. They dominated the landscape. As far as the eye could see, there were bundles of five, ten, even twenty apps, all brought to you in a shiny package, delivered with charm, class, style, and occasionally a bit of terrible faux-drama. </p>

<p>In these more urbane times we are left to mourn, to reminisce, and to shed but a single silent tear for those halcyon days.<a href="#footnote_0_976" title="November is National Novel Writing Month. I’m warming up. I’ll be writing on purple paper this year.">1</a></p>

<p>How did we come to this pass? What happened to the mighty, fighty software bundle? Whence the colossi, like the MacHeist, or the MacUpdate Bundle? Join us as CANS seeks to solve the mystery of the disappearing bundle.</p>

<p>“Three words for you: iOS,” says Perry Simm, whose mind, while forever voyaging, stopped long enough to talk to us. “Back in the day of desktops and laptops people bought ‘programs’ instead of ‘apps’. People bought them from all kinds of different vendors, instead of everything coming from Apple’s virtual warehouses. Bundles don’t work on the App Store, and people aren’t working on non-iOS apps anymore. The torch has been passed on.”</p>

<p>“The bundle was an weapon in the war between Mac and Windows. When the battlefront moved to the mobile space, it was like lobbing shells at unoccupied villages in France: fun for a while, but ultimately useless,” explained Ann Alogy, historian. We asked if she’d ever been told that her similes need work. “This isn’t the first time,” she responded.</p>

<p>As interesting as these interviews weren’t, we felt we needed to dig deeper, to go to the source, to utilize yet another exploration-based metaphor for actually talking to someone who actually knew what happened. So we did it: We made up a conversation with that <a href="http://www.macheist.com/static/about/Directorate/JohnCasasanta.jpg">guy with the huge red hair</a> that used to run <a href="http://www.macheist.com">MacHeist</a>. You know the one. John somebody.</p>

<p>We found him hanging out at the Helvetica Neue, a bistro/club for people with highly refined senses of graphic design. The club is airy and open, with birds flying gracefully between the understated ionic pillars that stand in neat rows, not actually supporting anything but the patrons’ sense of superiority over the common man. John was lounging on a triclinium, eating from a bento box resting on a table made of a single piece of aluminium.<br />
“The ‘Heist was fun when we were younger and times were wild. There was a certain youthful charm, a certain innocence in it. Also we were poor back then and had to actually do things for money.” he paused briefly to silently acknowledge Jonathan Ive as he walked past. “But now I seek greater refinement, greater sophistication and simplicity. While there was much to be gained from the ragged, rabid energy of MacHeist–experience with vendor relations, marketing, hundreds of thousands of dollars– I now seek enlightenment and phat cash through the creation and sale of simple iPhone apps.”</p>

<p>“Is there no hope for the bundles, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There is hope in moving on,” he answered, and turned back to his delicately seasoned rice and fish.</p>

<p>And there we stand. Well, not “there”, as in “still at the Helvetica Neue”, because they threw us out when we asked if they have root beer, but “there” as in “at that mental and emotional state” there. The hope of great new bundles dimmed, but a brighter, more expensive hope of greater software utility in the form of elegant little apps for iOS devices dawning o’er the purple east. We may never again see people with terrible faux-russian accents try to convince us that our actions will save Apple from the dread clutches of…someone<a href="#footnote_1_976" title="I never did figure out who the bad guy was supposed to be in that MacHeist">2</a> but we will be able to play Angry Birds. I only hope its enough.</p>

<p>Welcome to another episode of fireside chats. Today we look at two up and coming descendants of the monster that was WebTV set-top compu-media devices: Apple’s Apple TV and Google’s Google TV.<a href="#footnote_0_971" title="Creative Names Not Included">1</a></p>

<p>Welcome to you both.</p>

<p>Apple TV: It’s nice to be here.</p>

<p>Google TV: Where exactly is “here”? How did we get to a featureless gray void?</p>

<p>Moderator: For simplicity, I’m going to just call you Apple and Google, is that acceptable?</p>

<p>A: Certainly.</p>

<p>G: I mean, that gradient from below us to above us is nice, but what are we even standing on?</p>

<p>M: First question is for both of you. There’s some confusion over what value you bring to the living room experience. Where do you fit in to the modern entertainment center?</p>

<p>A: I think that set-top connectivity boxes like Google and me are meant to be a gateway to the increasingly massive amount of quality entertainment on the internet. When you buy a HD movie on iTunes you want to be able to watch it on your 50″ television, instead of your 13″ MacBook. I let you do just that.</p>

<p>G: While I agree at first, I find that I eventually have to steal Apple’s good ideas and get fired from his board of directors. But I kid. No, Apple TV has it basically correct. We bring the richness of the internet to the living room. There’s a lot more out there to watch than just YouTube, and even YouTube is better on the big screen.</p>

<p>M: Apple, what sets you apart from the competition?</p>

<p>A: Well, it’s the experience, isn’t it? Set me down, plug me in, and you’re off and running. There’s no learning curve; you already know how my interface works. You have instant access to all your photos, music, and movies on all your computers, and you can rent movies and TV shows instantly from the couch. </p>

<p>M: Google, same question.</p>

<p>G: What sets me apart is freedom, baby. I can do it all. search, watch TV on a number of websites, Netflix–</p>

<p>A: I can do Netflix!</p>

<p>G: Amazon Unbox, </p>

<p>A: I can…watch movies from iTunes.</p>

<p>M: Apple, please.</p>

<p>G: Anyway, you can get your content from anywhere. Websites will be able to create TV-specific views of their pages, and you’ll be able to see them on Google TV. Pretty soon you’ll be able to install apps on me as well.</p>

<p>A: I might get apps some day.</p>

<p>M: Apple, you seem a bit defensive about some of Google’s claims. Why is that?</p>

<p>A: Well, it’s nothing really. I think Google’s a little to focused on feature lists is all.</p>

<p>M: And that’s a problem?</p>

<p>A: Well, I prefer to focus on the overall experience.</p>

<p>G: Without getting too much into that, I feel the experience is enhanced by more data streams and more choices.</p>

<p>M: And you have both given our viewers something to think about, in terms of choice. One last question. Who do you think will win?</p>

<p>G: Nobody.</p>

<p>A: No one.</p>

<p>M: I’m sorry?</p>

<p>A: Look, what are we, really? Let’s be honest, this is just WebTV 3.0. People keep trying this little experiment, and it keeps tanking. Why would that change now?</p>

<p>G: He’s got a point. If you want a computer, go to your computer. You wanna watch a movie? just watch a movie.</p>

<p>A: If anyone is going to win, it’s my big brother, Mac Mini.</p>

<p>G: Oh, no doubt. That guy’s got it all over us. He can do anything either one of us can do, and he’s a real computer as well.</p>

<p>A: My existence is kind of embarrassing, when he’s around.</p>

<p>G: My existence is still kind of tenuous at best.</p>

<p>M: Well, this has been a thorough waste of our time then. Until next time, I’m your nameless Moderator, and this has been Fireside Chats. Goodnight.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we talk about something that people apparently do when they aren’t in grad school while working and raising kids: sleep.</p>

<p>Q: So, you’ve finally run out of mac software to make fun of, huh?</p>

<p>A: Hmmm? Wha? No. There’s ton of stuff out there. Thersa, thersa lotta software left. For example, I don’t think I’ve ever written about XCode!</p>

<p>Q: So, why don’t you do that one today?</p>

<p>A: Honestly? Because I’ve spent so much time in Visual Freakin’ Studio on Windows 7 that I can’t remember what Objective-C even looks…looks at trees.</p>

<p>Q: Trees?</p>

<p>A: Bah! Don’t you talk to me about trees. Especially binary trees.</p>

<p>Q: Why would Objective-C look at trees?</p>

<p>A: Everything looks at trees. We all have to look at trees. All day, every day. That’s basically all I do any more. Wonder why trees lose left children and leave off leaves.</p>

<p>Q: Normal human beings don’t have any idea what you’re talking about…</p>

<p>A: In a splay tree data structure…</p>

<p>Q: Whoa! Hey! I didn’t say we were interested! I just said we don’t know what you’re talking about. But you’re not talking about sleep.</p>

<p>A: Sleep is what happens when you decide that smashing the G, E, Z and F6 keys simultaneously with your face isn’t helping you get any closer to understanding right double rotations. Well, no; sleep is what happens after after you trip over the dog after deciding that smashing the G, E, Z, and F6 keys isn’t opening any doors in Windows or Linux or Mac, or Mac the Knife. That shark has pretty teeth, dear. Dear, that shark has pretty teeth.<a href="#footnote_0_969" title="I just rotated that sentence. ">1</a></p>

<p>Q: I can’t decide if I should feel sorry for you or just walk away.</p>

<p>A: Why not both?</p>

<p>Q: In a minute. So, do you have anything to say to your disappointed fans right now?</p>

<p>A: Steely Dan is a far better band than the Eagles.</p>

<p>Q: Controversial and timely. Well done. Okay go trip over a dog.</p>

<p>A: Ten-four, Roger Wilco. I’ll see you in Space Quest II.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we engage in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphaloskepsis">Omphaloskepsis </a>and emerge with <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/en/">OmmWriter Dāna</a>, the serene plain text editor for you.</p>

<p>Q: Serene master, my brain is like a million monkeys with no taste for Elizabethan drama, yet I sense that, in the middle of this welter, there exists some grain of wisdom that I might share.</p>

<p>A: In what way do monkeys plague your thoughts, my son?</p>

<p>Q: Each monkey steals a bit of my brain, and many of them put my thoughts on Twitter without my knowledge. Others are conversely addicted to the flow of monkey thoughts from all that I know.</p>

<p>A: Ah, Twitter and Facebook monkeys are formidable enemies of the serene warrior.</p>

<p>Q: And yet another monkey has grown overfond of the taste of potted meat product!</p>

<p>A: Yes, the Spam Monkey is also a fearsome warrior of distraction.</p>

<p>Q: How may I combat these monkeys, oh venerable one?</p>

<p>A: I’m 32.</p>

<p>Q: What?</p>

<p>A: I’m 32, I’m not “venerable”.</p>

<p>Q: Well, I couldn’t just call you “one” now could I?</p>

<p>A: You could have called me Dennis.</p>

<p>Q: You’re not called Dennis. And you’ve completely destroyed our serene mystical thing we had going on with your needless nerdy pythonism. </p>

<p>A: Look, I’ll level with you: OmmWriter can help. Quite a bit, actually. It tries hard to engage you both visually and aurally, so you’re less likely to break out and go look at email, because breaking from OmmWriter is a fierce jump, which slows your rate of random jumping. It also turns off your notifications via Growl, so you don’t see all the random stuff people show you.</p>

<p>Q: Ahh, and thus the monkeys are quietened. Thus may my true thoughts bloom as the lotus.</p>

<p>A: Indeed. </p>

<p>Q: How much will I pay for this ally in the war for focus?</p>

<p>A: The developers, in their wisdom, have left your donation amount up to you. Pay as much as you feel is appropriate. </p>

<p>Q: There is honor and merit in their actions.</p>

<p>A: As long as you pay more than $4.11. </p>

<p>Q: I shall do so straighta–</p>

<p>A: Or use the free version.</p>

<p>Q: Freedom is a treasured asset, a prize to be sought with all –</p>

<p>A: But I would pay to support their efforts, if I were you.</p>

<p>Q: To give to another is to increase the wealth of one’s sel–</p>

<p>A: And make sure the amount you pay ends in a “1″, because the devs think that’s lucky, and we should let them be lucky.</p>

<p>Q: You’re just going to keep interrupting me, aren’t you?</p>

<p>A: Yep.</p>

<p>Q: Okay, I’ll go be serene by myself and check out this OmmWriter thing. We’re don–</p>

<p>A: Okay bye!</p>

<p>Join us once again for Fireside Chats, where we bring two points of view together and hope they start hitting each other with chairs, Jerry Springer style. And if ever there was a pairing less likely to do that than our two current guests, we’ve never heard of it.</p>

<p>Today we have iOS, the up-and-coming jack-of-all-devices operating system, and OSX, the elegant master of big computers.<br />
Moderator: Gentlesystems, welcome.</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: It’s good to be here.</p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: Always a pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: iOS, you’ve become one of the largest, if not the largest, mobile operating systems in the world in just a few years. OSX, despite your acknowledged superiority, you still struggle to reach 10% of the desktop market. Why do you think that is?</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: I have built on the foundation laid by my honorable parent, OSX, and expanded into a new area, an area which before now didn’t really exist.</p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: I do not hold onto the mistakes of the past that limited my size. Does the gnarled pine curse the rock that forced its seedling into its current shape? Or does it not, instead, seek to turn this obstacle into a chance for greater, more unexpected beauty? Long have I envisioned the day where I might burst forth triumphant, although now I see that this victory may come through my offspring.</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: I am humbled and honored.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: So, OSX, not to tread on this tender moment, but it kinda sounds like you’re giving up there. </p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: The battle may still be won, but the field is no longer central to the war. Still, we put up the good fight, and expect success on this front.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: iOS, what about you? How do you see your battle going?</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: While it is unwise to try to predict the movements of one’s opponents, I am sanguine in my hopes for victory. the iPad is unrivaled, and no real rivals are seen on the horizon. the iPhone gains in popularity day by day, hardware mistakes notwithstanding. and the iPod Touch, as well, is in a class by itself.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: That’s true. Despite the continued offerings of Creative and Microsoft, there really isn’t a decent competitor to the iPod Touch, is there? And in some ways, it doesn’t look like there will be. But the iPad is due to see some new entrants into its market soon. How do you see these newcomers?</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: These devices are missing the one thing that makes the iPad unique.</p>

<p><strong>Mod</strong>: and that is?</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: Me. A touch-screen computer running Windows 7 is a mongrel that will have all the tell-tale signs of its desktop heritage cobbled into a mobile platform.</p>

<p><strong>Mod</strong>: And what about the WebOS and Android-based tablets due out in the next year or so?</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: There we may see some real challenge. Android is a formidable, if uncouth, foe. They seek victory not in the elegance and perfection of their attack, but rather in superiority of numbers.</p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: I’m still here, you know.</p>

<p><strong>Mod</strong>: So you see Android’s chances of domination resting in the number of devices that are deployed using Google’s OS, and not in the engineering quality of said OS?</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: There is little to fear, I think, in the “quality” of the Android OS. But it is free to run on any cell network, and this is worth considering.</p>

<p><strong>Mod</strong>: This “low-cost-broad-dispersal” technique worked once before, you know.</p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: Oh, bring that up, why don’t you? Look, Apple was young, they didn’t see it coming. And anyway, that was before my time.</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>: We have learned from the mistakes of the past, and you may also be sanguine that we will move to exceed our rivals at every turn.</p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: So I’m invisible and silent now all of the sudden, is that it? Nobody can hear me?</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Well, we’re out of time here. I’ve been chatting with an extremely confident iOS.</p>

<p><strong>OSX</strong>: And me! OSX! The best desktop OS! I’m still here.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Join me next time for more Fireside Chats.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we tackle Apple’s latest iPoddish offerings mano-a-nano.</p>

<p>Q: <strong>What happened to my video camera?</strong></p>

<p>A: Easy there. We don’t abuse  tags around here like that, sonny.</p>

<p>Q: So now I have to pony up for an iPad Junior<a href="#footnote_0_941" title="Why are we even calling the Touch an iPod any more?">1</a> to take full-motion video of my dog chasing his tail and running into a wall.</p>

<p>A: Wait, how often do you take that video?</p>

<p>Q: About once a week.</p>

<p>A: Now THAT is a dumb dog.</p>

<p>Q: He once attacked a leaf on the driveway.</p>

<p>A: Dogs do that all the time–</p>

<p>Q: And lost.</p>

<p>A: Wow. Now that’s impressive.</p>

<p>Q: You’d think so, but you’d be wrong. But the point is the nano, which was becoming a more and more respectable device with every iteration, has now become some sort of twisted, Lovecraftian demon spawn–</p>

<p>A: I’m gonna have to interrupt you there. You’re comparing this:[![iPod Nano 6th Generation][3]][3]</p>

<p>[]: http://crazyapplenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/overview_buystrip_nano20100901.jpg</p>

<p>To this:<br />

?<br />
Really?</p>

<p>[]: http://crazyapplenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/monster.jpg</p>

<p>Q: Well, okay, it’s not all that bad, I guess. But still, all my favorite features! Gone!</p>

<p>A: Your camera.</p>

<p>Q: Well yeah.</p>

<p>A: Because all the other features are there.</p>

<p>Q: What? No they aren’t.</p>

<p>A: I mean, FM Radio, Nike , Genius, it’s all there.</p>

<p>Q: No notes, no images, no movies, they’re all gone.</p>

<p>A: So what do you want to do? Cry? Buy a Zune? Maybe a <a href="http://us.store.creative.com/ZEN-XFi2-16GB-Black/M/B002NKLRES.htm">Zen</a>?</p>

<p>Q: Don’t be crass.</p>

<p>A: So, what’s your point?</p>

<p>Q: I just want…</p>

<p>A: Go ahead.</p>

<p>Q: I just want… I want Apple to love me.</p>

<p>A: There now, was that so hard?</p>

<p>Q: I mean, with all the attention they’ve been paying to the iPad and the iPhone, it feels like they don’t even care about those of us who use OSX and iPod OS anymore.</p>

<p>A: It can be hard to move on. But you’ve got to see the bright future beyond the current clouds.</p>

<p>Q: I don’t want to move on! I want everything to be the way it was before!</p>

<p>A: I know honey. But it will be okay, I promise. Listen, let me buy you a song on iTunes, like the old days. Will that help you feel better?</p>

<p>Q: That would…well, it would help.</p>

<p>A: Okay. Let’s go. But no more 90′s rap, okay? Pick something nice this time.</p>

<p>Q: I’ll try.</p>
