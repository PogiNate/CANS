<p>The FCC, CIA, and FDA have started a joint investigation into the design of Apple’s latest update to the Mac Mini.<br />
“We are concerned that the elegance and beauty of the new Mac Mini will influence the way people watch TV, as it will almost invariably be added to entertainment centers around the world.” said an FCC representative. “I mean, that thing can store every episode of LOST in HD, which is bad for reruns.”</p>

<p>“We are worried that the new unibody enclosure of the Mac Mini will affect people much like a drug, forcing people to buy more and more Minis until they can buy nothing else,” wrote the FDA. “We haven’t stopped thinking about it since it was announced.”</p>

<p>“We jumped in because there’s not a whole lot to do these days, what with the FBI taking over pretty much all of our work,” Said the CIA<a href="#footnote_0_863" title="At least, that’s what they want you to think…">1</a> .</p>

<p>Here at CANS we are trying to save up enough pennies to conduct our own research into the effects of the new Mac Mini’s HDMI port on our 23″ monitor that is currently connected to a loathsome Dell laptop. We estimate we will have the required number of pennies (70,000) by the middle of 2014. </p>

<p><em>Welcome to the first installment of Fireside Chats, a new feature where we discuss both sides of an issue in a relaxed, informal setting. These fireside chats are completely neutral and seek to understand both sides equally. In this fireside chat we’ll be pondering the ideological divide between iPads and games made by sixteen-year-olds with hacked copies of Macromedia’s Adobe’s decrepit web content development platform. Taking the part of the iPad will be Steve Jobs<a href="#footnote_0_858" title="or a reasonable facsimile thereof">1</a> . Taking the part of Flash will be a semi-concussed street “performance artist” who calls himself “Dr. Space”.  Let’s join them now.</em></p>

<p><strong>Mediator</strong>: Gentlemen, we’re here to discuss Flash on the iPad. Many people feel that not allowing Flash content is hurting the transcendent new device, while millions of others apparently don’t care at all. Steve, let’s start with you. What’s so bad about Flash?</p>

<p><strong>Steve Jobs</strong>: We know first hand that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash. We have been working with Adobe to fix these problems, but they have persisted for several years now. We don’t want to reduce the reliability and security of our iPhones, iPods and iPads by adding Flash.<a href="#footnote_1_858" title="Yes, most of these will come straight from Steve’s “Thoughts on Flash” on the Apple website.">2</a></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Space:</strong> WHAT? You gotta stop listening to those BRAIIIN-Beamers, Jobber! Flash, man, he so cool, he so cool it make me say YEAH! I gotta give a big shout out to my man Zorthac, because he DECIDED the flash! He knows what it is to BE the flash! I know he can be relied on, like my pet turtle, Slappy. Slappy, help me out here.<a href="#footnote_2_858" title="Dr. Space mostly comes from my brother in law, and a guy I met in the Philippines.">3</a></p>

<p><strong>Slappy:</strong> [Looks straight forward, then blinks slowly.]</p>

<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you gentlemen. Good points all around. Moving on, let’s talk about security. Gentlemen, both the iPad and the Flash platform have had security problems lately, although both could conceivably be blamed on your partners. Does Apple still hold that Flash would be an added security risk on the iOS family of devices?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Space:</strong> I hold up an apple, I see it, it sees me, my reflection on the waxy, fruity surface of the apple. Slappy, he bit the apple, and that’s what Jobber here bring to the people. MY PEOPLE! we KNOW what apple is, because it’s core grew in my belly!</p>

<p><strong>Steve Jobs:</strong> On the contrary, Symantec recently highlighted Flash for having one of the worst security records in 2009, and that’s just the beginning. Flash was designed for PCs using mice, not for touch screens using fingers.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> I don’t see how a mouse-driven interface would affect security–</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Space:</strong> Mice drive when MEN should be SLEEPIN’! Mice have seen the Wall of Truth, and they turned to eat it! I know they do! I garden the planets, and I have BEEN in the WALL!</p>

<p>**Moderator: **That to one side, and it’s a good point, I don’t think we’ve answered the security question.</p>

<p>**Steve Jobs: **The most important reason is the problems stemming from a third party supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor’s platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Mr. Jobs, again, this doesn’t really relate to the security issue. But since you bring it up, let’s discuss third party development tools. Apple has definitely settled on a platform–</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Space:</strong> When I settled on this platform called earth, I said to Slappy, “Slappy, you’re my only friend in the cosmos. Tell me, tell me Slappy, what is the TRUTH?” And Slappy bit me. RIGHT ON THE FIFTH FINGER! And that’s when I KNEW! I knew the truth so hard, I said YEAH! YEAH! It made an impression on me. IT made so great an impression, I don’t even remember it!</p>

<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Er, Mr. Jobs, your response?</p>

<p>**Steve Jobs: **Wow, man, how can I respond to that? I mean, he’s got a point. Look, you chose well. This guy, this guy is good. YEAH!</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Space:</strong> YEAH!</p>

<p><strong>Slappy:</strong> [turtle noises that Dr. Space assured us meant “YEAH!”]</p>

<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> And that’s all the time we have for today. Join us next time when we discuss the de-emphasis of OSX in the Apple mindset. Thank you.</p>

<p>As usual, I’ll be posting snarky comments about other people’s serious comments here<a href="#footnote_0_802" title="I’ll answer questions about where we’ve been for the past month later">1</a></p>

<p>11:01 am: Here’s my hoped for breakdown of the keynote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Steve Jobs announcing new products: 30 minutes</li>
  <li>Phil Schiller doing a speed run of Portal on an iMac and being blown away by it: 15 minutes</li>
  <li>Jony Ive talking about how his new industrial designs are better than the Mona Lisa: 5 minutes</li>
  <li>Full on flash bashing: 10 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>11:08: iPad (have you heard of it?) is apparently a “thing” that some people have “bought”</p>

<p>11:09: I have the Elements App. It was interesting for five minutes. I bought some iBooks. I have read them. I have far more than 2.5 per iPad.</p>

<p>11:10: iBooks will now be as cool as the Kindle reader on the iPad. (bookmarks, notes)</p>

<p>11:11: Ooooh, PDF in iBooks. Sorry, GoodReader!</p>

<p>11:13: “We are totally into Open, uncontrolled HTML5. As long as you do it our way. HTML5 isn’t standardized yet, you guys!””</p>

<p>11:14: Apple rejects apps that crash. Kinda like my MS professors. Curse them.</p>

<p>11:16: Netflix really is pretty good on the iPad. And will probably be pretty good (if small) on the iPhone.</p>

<p>11:20: Oh crap. Not farmville for the iPad. Please no. Please please please no.</p>

<p>11:21 Not push notifications from your farmville farm. Please, please no.</p>

<p>11:23 Farmville Demo is over. Finally. I feel dirty now. Somehow.</p>

<p>11:25: Guitar Hero. I couldn’t really care less.</p>

<p>11:27: Let’s please get to something that isn’t a game, nkay?</p>

<p>11:29: If Steve starts marching around, sweating, clapping, and chanting ”Developers” I’m gonna cry.</p>

<p>11:31: Wait, there’s going to be a new iPhone? Who knew?</p>

<p>11:32: That new phone looks…familiar, somehow.</p>

<p>11:34: I’d really like an iPhone, but I really don’t want any AT&amp;T stuff.</p>

<p>11:36: Wow, the new iPhone has ANTENNAE!</p>

<p>11:39: And PIXELS!</p>

<p>11:40: More about pixels. The new iPhone has better ones.</p>

<p>11:44: Network problems. Someone at Moscone West will be fired. Out of a cannon.</p>

<p>11:49: The new iPhone is full of not-very-interesting surprises.</p>

<p>11:51: It has a Gyroscope. I don’t know why.</p>

<p>11:53: Steve will now spend the rest of the keynote playing Jenga</p>

<p>11:54: the new iPhone has CAMERAS!</p>

<p>11:56: This pixel math sounds eerily like “Reganomics”. Video is useful.</p>

<p>11:57: iMovie for iPhone. Oh Man. Take that George Lucas!</p>

<p>11:59: As of next week, Pixar will make all their movies in iMovie for iPhone.</p>

<p>12:07: iOS 4. New features! Stuff! Less awkwardly-out-date name!</p>

<p>12:10: Things we already knew. But now we know them AGAIN!</p>

<p>12:13: Pandora: The only way to know that a mobile OS is worth anything.</p>

<p>12:17: iBooks on iPhone. It’s like Kindle, but better. Steve says so.</p>

<p>12:19: Winnie the Pooh on a very small screen, folks.</p>

<p>12:20: The notes you take will follow you. No matter where you go, no matter how you hide.</p>

<p>12:22: iAds. Connect emotionally to your customers’ wallets.</p>

<p>12:25: Target and citi want to have an emotional conversation with you in your iPhone apps.</p>

<p>12:26: What exactly is AT&amp;T advertising on iPhones?</p>

<p>12:30: Ads are finally done.</p>

<p>12:33: “One more thing” is video chatting.</p>

<p>12:35: STEVE HATES YOUR WIFI</p>

<p>12:36: voice chat only works with Jonathan Ive, unfortunately.</p>

<p>12:38: Apparently it works with Babies too.</p>

<p>12:40: This will be some kinda industry standard or something.</p>

<p>12:41: AT&amp;T will be semi-nice to you if you upgrade NOW</p>

<p>12:45: And that’s really about it.</p>

<p>12:49: Scott Forestall likes being excited about things.</p>

<p>12:54: Steve feels that a marriage of tech and liberal arts would work out well. Better than a marriage between techno music and folk songs.</p>

<p>12:55: And that’s all! It certainly is a new phone.</p>

<p>So, I posted a stupid comment on an article by Roger Ebert on my <a href="http://coals2newcastle.com">other blog</a>, figuring that no one would read it, because no one ever does. Apparently Ebert did, and posted a link on Twitter, and now I’m fielding about 10 hate comments an hour. Moral of the story: if you are going to post poorly thought out vile slanders of famous people make sure you do it on a humor blog. Better moral of the story: post well thought out vile slanders instead.</p>

<p>Last week’s Friday iFAQ was cancelled, indeed a number of iFAQ’s have been severely compromised recently, due to Q’s decision to go stand in line for an iPad. We worried that he didn’t come back right away, but figured he was just playing with his iPad a lot. To be fair, that’s what we were doing, so we didn’t think much more about it. But when he still wasn’t around last Friday we started to worry. So we went out to find him. This is what we found.</p>

<p>Friday evening, we are waiting for Q to show up and record the iFAQ with us. When our usual 7pm appointment came and went we decided something was up. A called his cell phone, but Q wasn’t answering. We decided to go out and look for him at first light Saturday morning.</p>

<p>A quick note about appearances: You may think that the real Q looks like the Q you see on the webpage as you read each week’s iFAQ. But that’s just a cue, to let you know who’s speaking. There aren’t giant queues of A’s and Q’s standing around on each web page, although that would be cute.</p>

<p>[![The Letter Q][2]][2]
Q, in a promotional headshot he had taken in 2009</p>

<p>No, the real Q, the actual, living glyph, has a house in the upscale Avenues district of Salt Lake City[1][2] and is a hearty 48-point Copperplate Gothic Bold upper case individual. At least, he used to be.</p>

<p>[]: http://crazyapplenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Q-before.png
 [2]: #footnote<em>0</em>798 “He lives on the corner of 14th and Q”</p>

<p>On Saturday morning we went down to the Apple store, looking high and low for Q, shouting “Q! Q! Where are you?” At one point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_star_trek">John de Lancie</a> showed up, and it wasn’t until he had called us fascinating mortals and wondered at our determination at continuing our menial existence that he got bored and pointed us to our fallen comrade.</p>

<p>Q was in a bad way. He hadn’t had any electrons or even pigments in days, and had passed out.  He had lost way too much weight, indeed his serifs were almost completely gone. His color had de-saturated to the point that he nearly blended in with the concrete, and his alpha channel was so weak that you could swear you could see your hand right through him. He looked more like a 5-point Helvetica Neue lowercase than his normal robust self. We immediately gave him a thin broth of weak ARGB values and started trying to figure out how to get him to a good foundry.</p>

<p>Ideally, of course, we would have taken him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Zapf">Hermann Zapf</a> himself, but weren’t sure he would survive the trip to Germany. Adobe is much closer, but current tensions between them and Apple left us unsure of the help we would receive at their hands. Finally we contacted Ross Carter (creator of the amazing <a href="http://pagehand.com/pagehand/">PageHand</a>) for help, knowing him to be a lover of fine typography, and not one to stand by idle while a poor glyph suffers.</p>

<p>“Q was in a bad way,” Ross told us later. “The CANS guys had made a good start, and his saturation was up to more stable #C0C0C0, but he was still fluctuating wildly. I transferred him into a PDF to keep him from getting any worse and started him on an Alpha drip.”</p>

<p>Q started to recover, growing more opaque and finally getting past the iffy 8-pt mark, but he’s still weak. We predict that he won’t be able to leave PageHand’s support structure for at least another week, which means we’ll have another substitute Q this Friday. But he’s already making jokes and is optimistic for a full recovery.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some good questions in mind, real zingers,” he told us, smiling a little. “I just hope A can keep up.”</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we bid a loving farewell to Apple’s venerable “desktop” operating system, OSX.</p>

<p>Q: Desktop? What’s a desktop?</p>

<p>A: Well, you see, back before there were iPhones and iPads, even before the ancient MacBook Air first crawled out of the primordial ooze, there was a thing called a “desktop computer”. It was kind of like an iPad, except for less portable.</p>

<p>Q: What do you mean?</p>

<p>A: Well, desktop computers didn’t have batteries, you see, so they had to stay in one place all the time</p>

<p>Q: Barbaric!</p>

<p>A: And they didn’t have touch screens, so you used a physical keyboard and a “mouse” to move the cursor around on the screen.</p>

<p>Q: I’m not okay with the rodent metaphor.</p>

<p>A: Many people weren’t. So that’s why Apple in their wisdom freed us from the scourge of non-portable computing.</p>

<p>Q: Were there any good things about these monstrosities?</p>

<p>A: Oh sure! Like, you could get apps from anywhere, even from stores <strong>not</strong> owned by Apple!</p>

<p>Q: No such thing!</p>

<p>A: And you could have screens of up to 30″ inches across, sometimes even two of them! But even the most humble of these gentle giants had at least 17″ of screen space.</p>

<p>Q: What would anyone do with that much space?</p>

<p>A: Well, remember those programs you could get from anywhere? You could run a WHOLE BUNCH of them at once, and Apple’s operating system for the desktop machines would let you switch between them, or even have two of them up on the screen <em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<p>Q: It’s like the future happened in the past!</p>

<p>A: There were many things in that era that are lost to us now, like the secret of Exposè, or devices that could be upgraded without being totally replaced. But Apple knows better for us now. They have declared that we must all compute on smaller screens that go with us everywhere, and blessed are we that follow in that righteous path.</p>

<p>Q: Amen.</p>

<p>A: Yet here is irony: those that create apps for us to use on our devices must still use those ancient beasts.</p>

<p>Q: What? How can this be?</p>

<p>A: Indeed, the desktop is not yet fully removed from Apple’s eye. The all-powerful XCode, that which generates the apps of the iPad and iPhone, does not run on our liberated devices. Indeed, it only runs on OSX, that most graceful of past OS’es.</p>

<p>Q: There is some serenity in that thought.</p>

<p>A: Yes, there is hope. The stationary ones may rise again; indeed Apple may yet release a new version of OSX. We can but wait. And hope.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the iPad’s large display, attractive design, and custom silicon. These features are well known and well documented. However, there is another element to the iPad that has yet to be thoroughly explored.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>“We had suspected that there was a significant gain in this area,” said Dr. E. Gobost, “but it wasn’t until we ran the actual tests that we realized exactly how significant Apple’s achievement was.”</p>

<p>“We feel the boost is due in part to the large Apple logo on the back of the iPad,” he continued. “The Apple logo on the iPhone was depressingly small, and was often covered by the user’s hand. This made it harder to show off the fact that you were using a top-of-the-line Apple product, and thus reduced the pretentiousness of the device. Apple has completely solved that in the design of the iPad.”</p>

<p>“It’s true,” verified Abus Ryder, iPad owner and pretentious snob. “With my iPod touch I had be really obvious that I was using a multi-touch device to properly impress the other passengers on my commute to work every day. Now the big glossy Apple logo lets everyone know that even though I’m riding the bus to work, It’s not because I’m a loser who makes very little money. It’s because I’m choosing to do so, you know, for the environment. So it’s a double score for me! Score! Score!”</p>

<p>“The iPad was designed to improve owners’ lives by being an excellent touch screen computer that allows you to effortlessly do all the things you love without being tied to a desk or a keyboard,” said a faceless Apple PR spokesperson<a href="#footnote_0_789" title="It was really creepy. I had to look away">1</a> . “Any increase in ego or pretentiousness is merely a side effect of owning a well-designed device, and wasn’t included by design.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gobost finds this hard to believe.</p>

<p>[![A graph of how pretentious various apple devices are.][3]][3]“I find that hard to believe. I mean look at these numbers,” he said, opening a Numbers Spreadsheet on his iPad and showing us a graph. He then decided that the graph wasn’t pretty enough in Numbers and re-created it in Keynote. “See how easy that was? That kind of simple, swipe-tap-drag simplicity is just for making life more fun for users. Tap! Swipe! Double-tap! Two-finger-tap! Done! That’s pure showmanship, friends.” Gobost did not explain the measurements used in his chart, other than to note that the values were in “SPUs”[2][3] .</p>

<p>He may just have a point.</p>

<p>“He may have a point,” conceded Punny Name, a person. “With the iMac, or the Power Mac, or even the Mac mini you have to get the person to come to your actual desk to show off your Apple awesomeness. The MacBook Pros are portable, sure, but hard to really show off in settings like the bus, the train, or standing in line at a fashionable whole foods store. The iPhones and iPods are easy to use anywhere, but showing them off is a challenge. Apple has finally hit that sweet spot: Big enough to show off, small enough to show off anywhere.”</p>

<p>Every now and again we answer really, **really **inFrequently Asked Questions to help those of you with no moral compasses deal with the zephyr-like and ephemeral changes in Basic Decency.</p>

<p>Q: So, I found this guy, and he found this thing, right? And it’s kinda not a thing that people are supposed to see yet, okay?</p>

<p>A: Give it back to the rightful owner.</p>

<p>Q: But, well, you see, I feel like I have a duty to the faceless crowds of people who visit my site on a daily basis. I mean, they deserve to know what’s coming, right?</p>

<p>A: Do you get paid per click?</p>

<p>Q: Well, kinda per pageview.</p>

<p>A: Give it back to the rightful owner, and give them all the money you made off of exploiting their trade secrets.</p>

<p>Q: Well, but what harm does it actually do? It’s not like anyone was surprised by what they saw, right? It’s kinda helping them in a way, be–because now people can plan for the future, and decide that they’ll want to buy the thing, when, you know, when it’s actually released.</p>

<p>A: Give it back, give them all the money you made, and apologize.</p>

<p>Q: What? Why? Why should I apologize for a mistake that someone on their side made? I mean, that guy, who found the thing? He tried to give it back!</p>

<p>A: Uh huh. But you sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Q: Well, we had to know if the thing belonged to…the company to whom we thought it might have belonged… Because, you know, maybe it didn’t.</p>

<p>A: Maybe. But you can sure get <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2010/04/18/the-miraculous-mysterious-engadget-iphone-4g/">knock-off “things”</a> a lot cheaper than $5,000-$10,000.</p>

<p>Q: Well, we thought it might have been real…</p>

<p>A: And instead of confirming it and giving it back to the original owner, you took it apart, put pictures of it all over the internet, drove unprecedented numbers of viewers to your site, made up flimsy cover stories for how you got the thing, possibly cost an engineer his job, and even if he stays employed you’ve disgraced him to his company.</p>

<p>Q: Well, we needed to tell the public–</p>

<p>A: No, you really didn’t. There’s all kinds of laws about that sort of thing, and even without the laws there are conventions, manners, social norms and <em>basic human decency</em> that should have told you that what you did is slimy and unpleasant. </p>

<p>Q: Look, it’s my job–</p>

<p>A: No, you look. This sort of thing is beyond the pale, alright? It’s things like this, and the people who take advantage of things like this, that give “new media” a bad name. I feel dirty just being an author of a <em>HUMOR *site *about *rumors *about</em> the company that made the thing. You could have played it cool. You could have reviewed the thing, taken your own internal pictures, learned a bit about it, quietly returned it, and have been really *really *accurate with your predictions on this one. You could have used it to take Gruber down a peg by being more right than him for a while. But now he looks like the good guy. And that annoys me. It annoys me enough to set you up as a straw man in an article where I actually used italics and bold typefaces without irony. Guessing what’s coming, finding “well placed sources” who give us tantalizing hints of what’s next, that’s what we do.<a href="#footnote_0_786" title="well, it’s what the real rumors sites do.  I just make fun of them">1</a> Paying for *possibly *stolen or lost property hoping that it *is *stolen or lost property? I call foul. That’s not just sneaking a peek at the secret stash of Christmas presents, that’s taking your webcam into the secret stash and posting what everyone’s getting on Facebook on November 30th. </p>

<p>Q:…</p>

<p>A: But it’s more than that. I thought you were some of the good guys. You do the best event coverage of any of the sites, and you have some of the best reviews on up and coming shiny toys out there. But you work for a <a href="http://gawker.com/">slimeball</a> and decided to play like slimeballs. That’s your choice, and I realize that refusal could have cost you your careers. I realize it’s insanely unlikely that I’ll ever be in the position you were put in when you were offered the shot at a once-in-a-lifetime news story. But if I am I hope nobody has cause to write an article like this about me.</p>
