<p>As usual, I’ll be posting snarky comments about other people’s serious comments here<a href="#footnote_0_802" title="I’ll answer questions about where we’ve been for the past month later">1</a></p>

<p>11:01 am: Here’s my hoped for breakdown of the keynote:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steve Jobs announcing new products: 30 minutes</li>
<li>Phil Schiller doing a speed run of Portal on an iMac and being blown away by it: 15 minutes</li>
<li>Jony Ive talking about how his new industrial designs are better than the Mona Lisa: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Full on flash bashing: 10 minutes</li>
</ul>


<p>11:08: iPad (have you heard of it?) is apparently a “thing” that some people have “bought”</p>

<p>11:09: I have the Elements App. It was interesting for five minutes. I bought some iBooks. I have read them. I have far more than 2.5 per iPad.</p>

<p>11:10: iBooks will now be as cool as the Kindle reader on the iPad. (bookmarks, notes)</p>

<p>11:11: Ooooh, PDF in iBooks. Sorry, GoodReader!</p>

<p>11:13: “We are totally into Open, uncontrolled HTML5. As long as you do it our way. HTML5 isn’t standardized yet, you guys!”&#8221;</p>

<p>11:14: Apple rejects apps that crash. Kinda like my MS professors. Curse them.</p>

<p>11:16: Netflix really is pretty good on the iPad. And will probably be pretty good (if small) on the iPhone.</p>

<p>11:20: Oh crap. Not farmville for the iPad. Please no. Please please please no.</p>

<p>11:21 Not push notifications from your farmville farm. Please, please no.</p>

<p>11:23 Farmville Demo is over. Finally. I feel dirty now. Somehow.</p>

<p>11:25: Guitar Hero. I couldn’t really care less.</p>

<p>11:27: Let’s please get to something that isn’t a game, nkay?</p>

<p>11:29: If Steve starts marching around, sweating, clapping, and chanting ”Developers” I’m gonna cry.</p>

<p>11:31: Wait, there’s going to be a new iPhone? Who knew?</p>

<p>11:32: That new phone looks…familiar, somehow.</p>

<p>11:34: I’d really like an iPhone, but I really don’t want any AT&amp;T stuff.</p>

<p>11:36: Wow, the new iPhone has ANTENNAE!</p>

<p>11:39: And PIXELS!</p>

<p>11:40: More about pixels. The new iPhone has better ones.</p>

<p>11:44: Network problems. Someone at Moscone West will be fired. Out of a cannon.</p>

<p>11:49: The new iPhone is full of not-very-interesting surprises.</p>

<p>11:51: It has a Gyroscope. I don’t know why.</p>

<p>11:53: Steve will now spend the rest of the keynote playing Jenga</p>

<p>11:54: the new iPhone has CAMERAS!</p>

<p>11:56: This pixel math sounds eerily like “Reganomics”. Video is useful.</p>

<p>11:57: iMovie for iPhone. Oh Man. Take that George Lucas!</p>

<p>11:59: As of next week, Pixar will make all their movies in iMovie for iPhone.</p>

<p>12:07: iOS 4. New features! Stuff! Less awkwardly-out-date name!</p>

<p>12:10: Things we already knew. But now we know them AGAIN!</p>

<p>12:13: Pandora: The only way to know that a mobile OS is worth anything.</p>

<p>12:17: iBooks on iPhone. It’s like Kindle, but better. Steve says so.</p>

<p>12:19: Winnie the Pooh on a very small screen, folks.</p>

<p>12:20: The notes you take will follow you. No matter where you go, no matter how you hide.</p>

<p>12:22: iAds. Connect emotionally to your customers’ wallets.</p>

<p>12:25: Target and citi want to have an emotional conversation with you in your iPhone apps.</p>

<p>12:26: What exactly is AT&amp;T advertising on iPhones?</p>

<p>12:30: Ads are finally done.</p>

<p>12:33: “One more thing” is video chatting.</p>

<p>12:35: STEVE HATES YOUR WIFI</p>

<p>12:36: voice chat only works with Jonathan Ive, unfortunately.</p>

<p>12:38: Apparently it works with Babies too.</p>

<p>12:40: This will be some kinda industry standard or something.</p>

<p>12:41: AT&amp;T will be semi-nice to you if you upgrade NOW</p>

<p>12:45: And that’s really about it.</p>

<p>12:49: Scott Forestall likes being excited about things.</p>

<p>12:54: Steve feels that a marriage of tech and liberal arts would work out well. Better than a marriage between techno music and folk songs.</p>

<p>12:55: And that’s all! It certainly is a new phone.</p>

<p>So, I posted a stupid comment on an article by Roger Ebert on my <a href="http://coals2newcastle.com">other blog</a>, figuring that no one would read it, because no one ever does. Apparently Ebert did, and posted a link on Twitter, and now I’m fielding about 10 hate comments an hour. Moral of the story: if you are going to post poorly thought out vile slanders of famous people make sure you do it on a humor blog. Better moral of the story: post well thought out vile slanders instead.</p>

<p>Last week’s Friday iFAQ was cancelled, indeed a number of iFAQ’s have been severely compromised recently, due to Q’s decision to go stand in line for an iPad. We worried that he didn’t come back right away, but figured he was just playing with his iPad a lot. To be fair, that’s what we were doing, so we didn’t think much more about it. But when he still wasn’t around last Friday we started to worry. So we went out to find him. This is what we found.</p>

<p>Friday evening, we are waiting for Q to show up and record the iFAQ with us. When our usual 7pm appointment came and went we decided something was up. A called his cell phone, but Q wasn’t answering. We decided to go out and look for him at first light Saturday morning.</p>

<p>A quick note about appearances: You may think that the real Q looks like the Q you see on the webpage as you read each week’s iFAQ. But that’s just a cue, to let you know who’s speaking. There aren’t giant queues of A’s and Q’s standing around on each web page, although that would be cute.</p>

<p><a href="#footnote_0_798" title="He lives on the corner of 14th and Q"><img src="#footnote_0_798" title="He lives on the corner of 14th and Q" alt="The Letter Q" /></a>
Q, in a promotional headshot he had taken in 2009</p>

<p>No, the real Q, the actual, living glyph, has a house in the upscale Avenues district of Salt Lake City<a href="#footnote_0_798" title="He lives on the corner of 14th and Q">1</a> and is a hearty 48-point Copperplate Gothic Bold upper case individual. At least, he used to be.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning we went down to the Apple store, looking high and low for Q, shouting “Q! Q! Where are you?” At one point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_star_trek">John de Lancie</a> showed up, and it wasn’t until he had called us fascinating mortals and wondered at our determination at continuing our menial existence that he got bored and pointed us to our fallen comrade.</p>

<p>Q was in a bad way. He hadn’t had any electrons or even pigments in days, and had passed out.  He had lost way too much weight, indeed his serifs were almost completely gone. His color had de-saturated to the point that he nearly blended in with the concrete, and his alpha channel was so weak that you could swear you could see your hand right through him. He looked more like a 5-point Helvetica Neue lowercase than his normal robust self. We immediately gave him a thin broth of weak ARGB values and started trying to figure out how to get him to a good foundry.</p>

<p>Ideally, of course, we would have taken him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Zapf">Hermann Zapf</a> himself, but weren’t sure he would survive the trip to Germany. Adobe is much closer, but current tensions between them and Apple left us unsure of the help we would receive at their hands. Finally we contacted Ross Carter (creator of the amazing <a href="http://pagehand.com/pagehand/">PageHand</a>) for help, knowing him to be a lover of fine typography, and not one to stand by idle while a poor glyph suffers.</p>

<p>“Q was in a bad way,” Ross told us later. “The CANS guys had made a good start, and his saturation was up to more stable #C0C0C0, but he was still fluctuating wildly. I transferred him into a PDF to keep him from getting any worse and started him on an Alpha drip.”</p>

<p>Q started to recover, growing more opaque and finally getting past the iffy 8-pt mark, but he’s still weak. We predict that he won’t be able to leave PageHand’s support structure for at least another week, which means we’ll have another substitute Q this Friday. But he’s already making jokes and is optimistic for a full recovery.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some good questions in mind, real zingers,” he told us, smiling a little. “I just hope A can keep up.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we bid a loving farewell to Apple’s venerable “desktop” operating system, OSX.</p>

<p>Q: Desktop? What’s a desktop?</p>

<p>A: Well, you see, back before there were iPhones and iPads, even before the ancient MacBook Air first crawled out of the primordial ooze, there was a thing called a “desktop computer”. It was kind of like an iPad, except for less portable.</p>

<p>Q: What do you mean?</p>

<p>A: Well, desktop computers didn’t have batteries, you see, so they had to stay in one place all the time</p>

<p>Q: Barbaric!</p>

<p>A: And they didn’t have touch screens, so you used a physical keyboard and a “mouse” to move the cursor around on the screen.</p>

<p>Q: I’m not okay with the rodent metaphor.</p>

<p>A: Many people weren’t. So that’s why Apple in their wisdom freed us from the scourge of non-portable computing.</p>

<p>Q: Were there any good things about these monstrosities?</p>

<p>A: Oh sure! Like, you could get apps from anywhere, even from stores <strong>not</strong> owned by Apple!</p>

<p>Q: No such thing!</p>

<p>A: And you could have screens of up to 30″ inches across, sometimes even two of them! But even the most humble of these gentle giants had at least 17″ of screen space.</p>

<p>Q: What would anyone do with that much space?</p>

<p>A: Well, remember those programs you could get from anywhere? You could run a WHOLE BUNCH of them at once, and Apple’s operating system for the desktop machines would let you switch between them, or even have two of them up on the screen <em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<p>Q: It’s like the future happened in the past!</p>

<p>A: There were many things in that era that are lost to us now, like the secret of Exposè, or devices that could be upgraded without being totally replaced. But Apple knows better for us now. They have declared that we must all compute on smaller screens that go with us everywhere, and blessed are we that follow in that righteous path.</p>

<p>Q: Amen.</p>

<p>A: Yet here is irony: those that create apps for us to use on our devices must still use those ancient beasts.</p>

<p>Q: What? How can this be?</p>

<p>A: Indeed, the desktop is not yet fully removed from Apple’s eye. The all-powerful XCode, that which generates the apps of the iPad and iPhone, does not run on our liberated devices. Indeed, it only runs on OSX, that most graceful of past OS’es.</p>

<p>Q: There is some serenity in that thought.</p>

<p>A: Yes, there is hope. The stationary ones may rise again; indeed Apple may yet release a new version of OSX. We can but wait. And hope.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Much has been said about the iPad’s large display, attractive design, and custom silicon. These features are well known and well documented. However, there is another element to the iPad that has yet to be thoroughly explored.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>“We had suspected that there was a significant gain in this area,” said Dr. E. Gobost, “but it wasn’t until we ran the actual tests that we realized exactly how significant Apple’s achievement was.”</p>

<p>“We feel the boost is due in part to the large Apple logo on the back of the iPad,” he continued. “The Apple logo on the iPhone was depressingly small, and was often covered by the user’s hand. This made it harder to show off the fact that you were using a top-of-the-line Apple product, and thus reduced the pretentiousness of the device. Apple has completely solved that in the design of the iPad.”</p>

<p>“It’s true,” verified Abus Ryder, iPad owner and pretentious snob. “With my iPod touch I had be really obvious that I was using a multi-touch device to properly impress the other passengers on my commute to work every day. Now the big glossy Apple logo lets everyone know that even though I’m riding the bus to work, It’s not because I’m a loser who makes very little money. It’s because I’m choosing to do so, you know, for the environment. So it’s a double score for me! Score! Score!”</p>

<p>“The iPad was designed to improve owners’ lives by being an excellent touch screen computer that allows you to effortlessly do all the things you love without being tied to a desk or a keyboard,” said a faceless Apple PR spokesperson<a href="#footnote_0_789" title="It was really creepy. I had to look away">1</a> . “Any increase in ego or pretentiousness is merely a side effect of owning a well-designed device, and wasn’t included by design.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gobost finds this hard to believe.</p>

<p><a href="#footnote_1_789" title="Standard Pretentiousness Units"><img src="#footnote_1_789" title="Standard Pretentiousness Units" alt="A graph of how pretentious various apple devices are." /></a>“I find that hard to believe. I mean look at these numbers,” he said, opening a Numbers Spreadsheet on his iPad and showing us a graph. He then decided that the graph wasn’t pretty enough in Numbers and re-created it in Keynote. “See how easy that was? That kind of simple, swipe-tap-drag simplicity is just for making life more fun for users. Tap! Swipe! Double-tap! Two-finger-tap! Done! That’s pure showmanship, friends.” Gobost did not explain the measurements used in his chart, other than to note that the values were in “SPUs”<a href="#footnote_1_789" title="Standard Pretentiousness Units">2</a> .</p>

<p>He may just have a point.</p>

<p>“He may have a point,” conceded Punny Name, a person. “With the iMac, or the Power Mac, or even the Mac mini you have to get the person to come to your actual desk to show off your Apple awesomeness. The MacBook Pros are portable, sure, but hard to really show off in settings like the bus, the train, or standing in line at a fashionable whole foods store. The iPhones and iPods are easy to use anywhere, but showing them off is a challenge. Apple has finally hit that sweet spot: Big enough to show off, small enough to show off anywhere.”</p>

<p>Every now and again we answer really, <strong>really </strong>inFrequently Asked Questions to help those of you with no moral compasses deal with the zephyr-like and ephemeral changes in Basic Decency.</p>

<p>Q: So, I found this guy, and he found this thing, right? And it’s kinda not a thing that people are supposed to see yet, okay?</p>

<p>A: Give it back to the rightful owner.</p>

<p>Q: But, well, you see, I feel like I have a duty to the faceless crowds of people who visit my site on a daily basis. I mean, they deserve to know what’s coming, right?</p>

<p>A: Do you get paid per click?</p>

<p>Q: Well, kinda per pageview.</p>

<p>A: Give it back to the rightful owner, and give them all the money you made off of exploiting their trade secrets.</p>

<p>Q: Well, but what harm does it actually do? It’s not like anyone was surprised by what they saw, right? It’s kinda helping them in a way, be–because now people can plan for the future, and decide that they’ll want to buy the thing, when, you know, when it’s actually released.</p>

<p>A: Give it back, give them all the money you made, and apologize.</p>

<p>Q: What? Why? Why should I apologize for a mistake that someone on their side made? I mean, that guy, who found the thing? He tried to give it back!</p>

<p>A: Uh huh. But you sure didn’t.</p>

<p>Q: Well, we had to know if the thing belonged to…the company to whom we thought it might have belonged… Because, you know, maybe it didn’t.</p>

<p>A: Maybe. But you can sure get <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2010/04/18/the-miraculous-mysterious-engadget-iphone-4g/">knock-off “things”</a> a lot cheaper than $5,000-$10,000.</p>

<p>Q: Well, we thought it might have been real…</p>

<p>A: And instead of confirming it and giving it back to the original owner, you took it apart, put pictures of it all over the internet, drove unprecedented numbers of viewers to your site, made up flimsy cover stories for how you got the thing, possibly cost an engineer his job, and even if he stays employed you’ve disgraced him to his company.</p>

<p>Q: Well, we needed to tell the public–</p>

<p>A: No, you really didn’t. There’s all kinds of laws about that sort of thing, and even without the laws there are conventions, manners, social norms and <em>basic human decency</em> that should have told you that what you did is slimy and unpleasant.</p>

<p>Q: Look, it’s my job–</p>

<p>A: No, you look. This sort of thing is beyond the pale, alright? It’s things like this, and the people who take advantage of things like this, that give “new media” a bad name. I feel dirty just being an author of a <em>HUMOR </em>site <em>about </em>rumors <em>about</em> the company that made the thing. You could have played it cool. You could have reviewed the thing, taken your own internal pictures, learned a bit about it, quietly returned it, and have been really <em>really </em>accurate with your predictions on this one. You could have used it to take Gruber down a peg by being more right than him for a while. But now he looks like the good guy. And that annoys me. It annoys me enough to set you up as a straw man in an article where I actually used italics and bold typefaces without irony. Guessing what’s coming, finding “well placed sources” who give us tantalizing hints of what’s next, that’s what we do.<a href="#footnote_0_786" title="well, it’s what the real rumors sites do.  I just make fun of them">1</a> Paying for <em>possibly </em>stolen or lost property hoping that it <em>is </em>stolen or lost property? I call foul. That’s not just sneaking a peek at the secret stash of Christmas presents, that’s taking your webcam into the secret stash and posting what everyone’s getting on Facebook on November 30th.</p>

<p>Q:…</p>

<p>A: But it’s more than that. I thought you were some of the good guys. You do the best event coverage of any of the sites, and you have some of the best reviews on up and coming shiny toys out there. But you work for a <a href="http://gawker.com/">slimeball</a> and decided to play like slimeballs. That’s your choice, and I realize that refusal could have cost you your careers. I realize it’s insanely unlikely that I’ll ever be in the position you were put in when you were offered the shot at a once-in-a-lifetime news story. But if I am I hope nobody has cause to write an article like this about me.</p>

<p>You may have been wondering what happened to me over the past two weeks that nothing has been posted. Yes, an occasional twitter update, but not much beyond that. And it would be totally in keeping with this site’s mandate to assert that I had been left in a bar by an Apple engineer who’d had one too many German beers. Or I could say I was too German for Apple, and thus left in an iPhone by a Barrister. It would not be stretching my credibility too far to even suggest that I was barred from Germans by two left Apple beers.</p>

<p>I could also go on a long rant about <a href="http://gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo </a>being a bunch of money-grubbing lowlifes, and strongly avow a desire to see them get hung out to dry in court. But I’m not going to do that either. Truth is, I think Gizmodo is a great site and sincerely hope that they continue to make millions of dollars, and then use those millions to get <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/04/19/gizmodo_may_have_paid_10k_for_exclusive_iphone_4g_prototype.html">absurdly low prices</a> on ill-gotten hardware prototypes. Also, good luck to Brian Lam and Jason Chen when they try to get into the next event at Moscone West<img src="#footnote_0_780" title="But I’m sure they can buy passes from someone who “found them in a bar”" alt="1" /></p>

<p>Or I could wax lyrical about my iPad and the way it has filled a niche in my life, changed how I work and play, and made me a better and more well rounded person. I could discuss the amazing touch screen, the simple beauty of the Numbers app, which I have been using the heck out of; or fondly discuss the time I’ve spent reading in iBooks and the awesomeness of being able to touch a word and instantly access it’s definition in a dictionary, or look it up in the book and on Wikipedia. I could get misty-eyed relating the joy of streaming MST3K via Netflix to my couch in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>But I’m not going to do that. The reality is that I have been involved in Very Serious Things of a Positive Nature that have taken Considerable Time<a href="#footnote_1_780" title="Real estate, ya’ll">2</a>. As you can tell, I’ve also been putting in some time with Winnie-the -Pooh on the iPad with my kids.</p>

<p>But that sort of thing does not good blogging make. So instead I’ll offer to make it up to you with not one but two iFAQ’s this week, as well as an investigative report the likes of which we haven’t featured since the early days of CANS. Stay tuned to this channel!</p>

<p>So, after staining in line for an hour in the cold mountain air, I got my iPad and have come to some completely un-startling conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The iPad is pretty big.</li>
<li>It really is very fast, which shouldn’t be a surprise, because everything it’s running was designed for it.</li>
<li>The multitouch and the keyboard are fine. I’m typing this on the new WordPad app for iPad.</li>
<li>People who just dropped hundreds of dollars for a device rarely complain about said device.</li>
<li>Stephen Fry was right: Douglas Adams would have loved this thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we hop right up on that bandwagon and take your questions about the not-actually-released-to-the-general-public iPad!</p>

<p>Q: So how do you like it so far?</p>

<p>A: I’m sorry?</p>

<p>Q: Your review iPad? How is it?</p>

<p>A: Oh, right, the…the review iPad that Apple sent me. Yeah. It’s great stuff. I mean, it’s all… all shiny, and…full of features…<a href="#footnote_0_768" title="Except for the features that Ive thinks would have detracted from the experience. ">1</a></p>

<p>Q: You don’t have a review iPad, do you?</p>

<p>A: No, I totally do! It’s right here! In…in fact, I’m writing these responses on it right now!</p>

<p>Q: Why don’t you have a review unit? I mean, Pogue does, that one<a href="http://ihnatko.com/"> really hard to spell</a> guy does, Gruber probably has four, heck, even <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1976935,00.html">Stephen Fry</a> got one. But they just skipped right over you, huh?</p>

<p>A: I don’t know what you’re talking about! I’m using that iPad all day every day!</p>

<p>Q: I mean, Pogue, of course. And Mossberg, sure. Even Gruber’s a given, because he’d whine really really loud if they didn’t give him one to play with. But then there’s you. Left out. In the cold.</p>

<p>A: I know! What’s up with that? Of all those guys, I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who has been Apple Product Professional Platinum Certified from 2005-2009 continuously<a href="#footnote_1_768" title="No, really, I have. Every year.">2</a> Mossberg wouldn’t know how to strategically position the value of MobileMe if he had Nimitz, Sherman and Patton helping him! If anyone could help them move ‘Pads, it’s me. But no. Just give ‘em to the noisy guys. Hmph.</p>

<p>Q: You wanna talk about it?</p>

<p>A: No. I’ma go sulk until I get in line to buy an iPad tomorrow. Like all the normal people.</p>

<p>Q: All the “normal people” with $500-$800 to chuck at a new toy.</p>

<p>A: Dude, these are <em>Apple </em>people.</p>

<p>Q: Right, right. Sorry. Forgot there for a second.</p>

<p>A: Well, you’re new. It’s forgivable. This time.</p>
