<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Listen, guys, we’ve got to get this right. </p>

<p><strong>Phil Schiller</strong>: Okay, sorry, Tim. We’re ready this time.</p>

<p><strong>Jony Ive</strong>: In the iMac, the peaceful iMac, Lion’s been installed!</p>

<p><strong>Scott Forstall</strong>: De-we-um-um-a-way!</p>

<p><strong>Ive</strong>: On the MacBook, the 13” MacBook, Lion’s been installed!</p>

<p><strong>Forstall</strong>: WEEEEEEEEEE-de-de-de a Whum-a-way!</p>

<p><strong>Schiller</strong>: Hush my darling, iOS and Lion, share lots of good ideas. Full-screen apps and, gestures for actions, make Lion excellent!</p>

<p><strong>Forstall</strong>: Hey! Hey! Whoa-a-wo! Whoa-a-wo a Wheem-o-whum-whum-a-way!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>At first, it just doesn’t make sense. <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> is selling, <em>selling</em> XCode, that amazing—and previously free—programmer’s delight of an IDE that is the gateway to the riches of putting your programs in the App Stores. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, XCode 4 is a massive improvement on the previous versions, with everything integrated into a single window, a massive improvement on the previous versions’ tendency to spread windows over your entire desktop and eventually into other Spaces, just because there are so dang many of them. The new debugger is faster, more intuitive, gives you good stack traces, even on multiple threads, and actually tries to trace your local variables and display them in a way that makes sense to humans, again something at which XCode 3 struggled. </p>

<p>So many of us purchased XCode 4 from the app store, telling ourselves that, considering how much Windows developers pay for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/premium">Visual Studio</a> we were getting off easy. And we downloaded the 4.5 Gigabyte file, and we ran the installer, and everything was good. XCode 4 was installed! Life was happy. Blithely we deleted the Installer file that the App Store dropped into our Applications folders and started tinkering around with all the new features, like Git integration and a useful timeline view of code changes and whatnot.</p>

<p>Then, a few days later, Apple released version 4.0.1 of the app. Well, we had noticed a few things that were kinda buggy with the initial release, so that’s to be expected. We go into the App Store, expecting an upgrade notification and…nothing. The App Store says we haven’t installed XCode 4. But look! It’s running right there! Lo and behold, deleting the 4.5 Gigabyte installer file from our Applications folder is what told the App Store that we no longer had XCode on our drive. So we download the new version—all 4.5 Gigabytes of it—and reinstall. The awful truth dawns slowly: we have to keep that stupid installer file to get our “convenient” automatic updates.</p>

<p>This, I feel, is too coincidental. It is clearly a joke, played upon the Apple developer community and their ISP’s. Apple is too smart to saddle their developers with a gigantic dead weight file and massive downloads for every patch release. Fortunately, they’ve given us some clues. Look at the version number: <strong>4.0.1</strong>. Does that suggest anything to you? Looks a lot like 4/1, doesn’t it? Yep, it’s an April Fool’s day joke. </p>

<p>Okay, Apple, you’ve had your fun. Now let’s make with version 4.0.2 getting rid of the annoyance factors. I’ve got better uses for that huge chunk of hard drive space. Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Cupertino <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> announced today that they are “concerned” that the number of Full-Screen Writing Programs may soon be more than the Apple Ecosystem can handle, and that they will be declaring an “Open Season” on the little blighters.</p>

<p>“It started out innocently enough,” said Sina Tamaddon, VP of Applications at Apple, Inc. “We had <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>, which was a nice little app. I mean, get serious, it’s TextEdit stretched out and colored. But really, no harm done. Later some of the bigger writing apps, like Ulysses and <a href="http://literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a> added full screen views. Heck, we added it to Pages. But now these little full-screen text editor programs are popping up like mice. <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">OmmWriter Dana</a> added some pretty music and background graphics, but this new <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>? It’s like Pages on the iPad for the Mac. We should have come up with that!</p>

<p>“The full-Screen Writing program epidemic is a small part of the larger threat,” said Dr. Weisman, a made-up pompous guy with leather patches on his elbows. No, no tweed jacket. “Like any ecosystem, the Mac app ecosystem needs to maintain a delicate balance. Too many graphics programs and the businessmen wander off. Too many spreadsheets, and there go all your artists,” at this point Weisman started to giggle. “I’m just kidding. Artists would be eaten alive on a PC. Two seconds after they brought it home it’d be so full of viruses and spyware they’d have to unplug it and take the battery out just to get it to stop shouting obscene phrases at them. But that’s beside the point. The point is, the number of writing programs currently in the mac ecosystem is threatening that delicate balance. Scrivener, we’ve got nothing against Scrivner. And <a href="http://pagehand.com/">Pagehand</a>, we like Pagehand.<a href="#footnote_0_1111" title="Apparently Dr. Weisman also likes repeating himself.">1</a> But these newcomers are starting to crowd out the long-standing, upstanding, outstanding old guys like <a href="http://www.nisus.com/">NisusWriter</a> or <a href="http://www.redlers.com/">Mellel</a>. Sure, the new ones are easy to use. But they don’t have history, or deep roots, and they don’t keep people from flowing downhill into PC territory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly,” Tamaddon said, wresting control back from the somewhat creepy doctor. “so, starting in the summer of 2011, we will be selling tags for hunters to remove certain Full-Screen Writing programs from the ecosystem. We want to make sure it’s done humanely, no porting a program to Linux or anything like that. We’re thinking that tags will begin at $40, after you join the Apple Hunter Program, which is quite reasonable at $99/year, and includes a license for XCode 4.”</p>

<p>Tamaddon mentioned that Scott Forstall would be monitoring this program closely, and if it proved successful would be offering a similar system for “all those dang iOS ToDo list apps.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Welcome to another Fireside Chat. Today we have the latest hotness in in the Apple lineup: the iPhone 4 and the up and coming iPad 2. Gentledevices, welcome to the studio.</p>

<p>iPhone: Thank you, it’s good to be here.</p>

<p>iPad: What’s that, iPhone? You cut out there for a second.</p>

<p>Moderator: iPad, remember, we don’t do antennagate jokes here.</p>

<p>iPad: Sorry. Won’t happen again.</p>

<p>iPhone: No worries, cousin.</p>

<p>Moderator: Well, let’s get started. iPhone, what effect do you think this new generation of iPads will have on you and your sales?</p>

<p>iPhone: Well it can only be positive, can’t it? I mean, we’re not really in competition are we? I think of us as a team, two players on the same side.</p>

<p>iPad: I have to agree. It’s like asking what kind of effect my sales will have on the sales of Mac Minis. Sure, we cost about the same, but we’re totally different products with entirely different applications. Any one of us doing well only helps the others. </p>

<p>Moderator: So, iPad, you feel that your success will only help iPhone, is that correct?</p>

<p>iPad: Yes.</p>

<p>iPhone: I agree. </p>

<p>Moderator: So, do you feel that your competition benefits from this kind of synergy?</p>

<p>iPhone &amp; iPad: Competition?</p>

<p>Moderator: The Android OS is looking to move into both of your spaces, and is definitely making inroads into your territory iPhone. And there are a lot of up and comers in your field, iPad.</p>

<p>iPhone: Well, there’s two questions there, really–</p>

<p>iPad: Yeah, the question of the threat posed by Android–</p>

<p>iPhone: And how well the Android players will work together.</p>

<p>Moderator: That works. Okay, feel free to answer those questions in any order you wish.</p>

<p>iPad: You first.</p>

<p>iPhone: Okay. Well, first: Android has its adherents. There are things that it does well. I don’t want to take that away from my worthy competitior. But what they don’t have is the integration–</p>

<p>iPad: or any real way to match the iOS experience.</p>

<p>Moderator: It seems to come down to iOS a lot of the time, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>iPhone: The experience is both our hardware and the software, it’s an integration. And that’s what’s missing in the Android universe.</p>

<p>iPad: Some Android software doesn’t work on some modern hardware, the speed of the updates is controlled by the carrier, it’s a rough world.</p>

<p>iPhone: So yeah, that’s a real advantage on our side.</p>

<p>iPad: Another is that we are working together, one company, one vision. We don’t have different manufacturers trying to outdo each other.</p>

<p>iPhone: Yeah, exactly. An iPhone is an iPhone, there’s no HTC vs. Motorola stuff going on here.</p>

<p>Moderator: That’s definitely a point. Although some would claim that the monolithic nature of your product line is a negative, not a positive.</p>

<p>iPad: Oh man, did someone let Zombie Richard Stallman in here?</p>

<p>iPhone: Wow, there hasn’t been a ZRMS joke on this blog since…wow, since before I was introduced. Anyway, carry on.</p>

<p>iPad: My point is just that it seems like the people that worry about that are just the Open Source fanatics.</p>

<p>Moderator: Some would say that Open Source is actually a useful and beneficial concept. In fact, OSX is based on the BSD, and Apple contributes to a number of Open Source projects.</p>

<p>iPad: but not us. We’re all Apple baby. At least, as far as you know. Good luck getting a look at our internals, too. We’re But seriously, what’s so bad about vendor lock-in?</p>

<p>iPhone: Look, you can have open source, or you can have a good user experience, but so far you can’t have both.</p>

<p>Moderator: Wow, that’s deeply insightful. And a little scary, really. Okay, one last question: Windows Phone 7? What do you think?</p>

<p>iPhone: Microsoft gave up and decided to fight a different battle. Has nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>Moderator: We’ve been chatting with a very confident, and not very funny, pair of devices ladies and gentlemen. And remember: around here, we don’t talk about Antennagate. Join us next time when we talk to the Mac App Store and iTunes and see how they feel about sharing an OS.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>**10:00- **Steve is on stage! But not made of metal, which is disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>10:05-</strong> iPads are selling like really expensive hotcakes. Everyone loves them.</p>

<p>**10:15- **Doctors can show you your x-rays without you getting out of bed with their iPad. “This is where we think I left my watch,” says Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>**10:16- **Kids love iPads too! Who knew?</p>

<p>**10:17- **The iPad…loves you. It loves children. It’s basically an angel of love and light and love.</p>

<p><strong>10:18-</strong> iPad 2 gets announced today. Say goodbye to the copycats.</p>

<p>**10:19- **New Processor! Faster! Dual core! Did we mention faster? It’s faster. That’s why it’s called “A5”.</p>

<p><strong>10:20-</strong> Cameras! Gyroscopes! Miracles!</p>

<p>**10:21- **It’s thinner too. Faster! Thinner! Cameras!</p>

<p>**10:22- **White iPad. ugly.</p>

<p>**10:23- **Verision and AT&amp;T. I have nothing to say about that.</p>

<p>**10:24- **The white one is still really ugly.</p>

<p>**10:25- **The prices, they no move. No come down, but no go up. So there you go.</p>

<p>**10:25- **They ship on March 11th. Take that, all you other tablets that haven’t shipped yet.</p>

<p>**10:27- **For $40 you can have a weird port splitter thing. Charge and use all at once! You know you want it.</p>

<p>**10:30- **Weird new magno-roll-up cover thingy. Looks…cool? if you like the color light blue.</p>

<p>**10:31- **A RAINBOW of colors! A rainbow that includes three shades of what amounts to “black or gray” And executive leather covers. For the discerning user.</p>

<p><strong>10:32-</strong> Scott Forestall is out, and is feeling intense about iOS 4.3</p>

<p>**10:35- **iPad switch does what YOU want, baby. It’s your switch. As long as you want it to mute or lock rotation.</p>

<p>**10:36- **iPhone 4 is now a hotspot.</p>

<p>**10:37- **Photobooth demos. I’m still not over the original OSX photobooth demos. Please stop.</p>

<p><strong>10:39-</strong> FaceTime. Yep. Yep.</p>

<p>**10:41- **Big stuff coming out on March 11th.</p>

<p>**10:42- **iMovie for iPad. All the Pixar engineers who have been working with iMovie for iPhone breathe a sigh of relief. Finally! a slightly larger screen!</p>

<p><strong>10:44-</strong> iMovie for iPad is…a lot like the OSX version. But it’s got a cool marquee thing on the home screen, so that’s cool, right?</p>

<p><strong>10:48-</strong> My limited patience for iMovie demos is coming to an end. Seriously, guys. Move on.</p>

<p>**10:49- **Steve just revealed how old he is “It blows my mind, this stuff.” He may have well added “What with the tapping and the rotating and the looking and the making movies? I don’t know.”</p>

<p>**10:50- **GarageBand for iPad. This one make sense. But still, the demo better be short.</p>

<p>**10:52- **Moving on. Okay, thanks for the GarageBand demo. Moving on now. Please?</p>

<p><strong>10:53-</strong> “This is a window into a much larger piano”. I’m pretty sure that’s not how that works.</p>

<p>**10:55- **Apparently the rest of the demo is all GarageBand, all the time.</p>

<p>**10:56- **Drums. DO NOT USE DRUMSTICKS! Use your fingers. Or our new iSticks.</p>

<p><strong>10:57-</strong> Smart guitar: the guitar is smart, so you don’t have to be.</p>

<p>**11:00- **Okay, I’m going to just be over there somewhere until they’re done talking about GarageBand. Talk amongst yourselves.</p>

<p>**11:03- **Garage band is finally done. That was painful.</p>

<p>**11:05- **“Now we made a video that I’d love to show you.” Did they make it in iMovie on an iPad 2?</p>

<p>**11:06- **Jony Ive likes the iPad 2 A. LOT.</p>

<p><strong>11:09-</strong> Kinda bummed they didn’t make iWeb for the iPad.</p>

<p>**11:11- **Steve is on stage, wrapping things up…hopefully. Unless he’s got some cool news about something else.</p>

<p>**11:12- **Steve is giving a speech about DNA and technology and stuff. It sounds kinda mystical.</p>

<p>**11:13- **And that’s all folks! Thanks for joining us in joining others…or something. And remember, if you enjoyed this post, why not buy your editor an iPad 2? It’s the classy thing to do.</p>

<p>Well, no, nobody’s dead. I’m just tired of calling it meta-live blogging or pseudo-live blogging or some such thing. So I came up with this really emo title instead. Now you’d think I’d come up with a  better title. But you’d be wrong. This is what we’re going with.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The point is, Time-stamped hilarity is coming your way later today. I’m not dead. I think I’ll go for a walk.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>this week we talk about the newest thing in physical IO: LightPeak Thunderbolt!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Q: So, What makes Thunderbolt better than other stuff?</p>

<p>A: Speed. Pure, unbridled fastness. Faster than fast, and daisy-chainable, Thunderbolt is–</p>

<p>Q: a lot like Firewire. You know, Apple’s last failed attempt at pushing a new IO specification on all of us. All they do is force LaCie to make a few hard drives that are outlandishly expensive because they use non-standard ports.</p>

<p>A: Firewire isn’t a failed technology! It’s just not…fully embraced.</p>

<p>Q: What about ExpressCard?</p>

<p>A: ExpressCard…could have done better, sure, but–</p>

<p>Q: And Firewire</p>

<p>A: you already said that one.</p>

<p>Q: Ah, but I was talking about Firewire 800 this time.</p>

<p>A: Okay,well, yeah, Firewire 800 hasn’t really taken off, athough there are people that use it.</p>

<p>Q: We’ll call them “People who use macs to make movies” and move on.</p>

<p>A: It’s not Just…okay, fair enough. But Thunderbolt is–</p>

<p>Q: A lot like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Display_Connector">ADC</a>?</p>

<p>A: We don’t talk about the ADC around here.</p>

<p>Q: Face it, Apple makes a lot of amazing technology, but they just don’t drive hardware standards. Pretty much every connector they champion ends up in second place. Look at DisplayPort.</p>

<p>A: Hey, now, you can’t call DisplayPort a failed connector yet! It’s still in the works! Dell is using it! Lots of people are using it!</p>

<p>Q: To connect to Apple Cinema Displays. </p>

<p>A: Right. No! To connect to all kinds of high end monitors. And besides, what about all the changes that Apple has made? What about the death of the Floppy drive? or the death of the stylus?</p>

<p>Q: Granted, they’re good at showing the world what our hardware should do, or rather, what it should stop doing. I mean, using a stylus, remember that?</p>

<p>A: Always losing it, trying to get your finger to be precise enough on those terrible resistive displays…</p>

<p>Q: Or using a ballpoint pen lid, because if you used the actual pen you’d get your screen all covered in ink.</p>

<p>A: Yeah, those were the terrible old days. Learning some new way to write so it would more-or-less understand your handwriting–</p>

<p>Q: But of course, half the time you just gave up and used the on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p>A: Well sure, it was faster to hunt and peck than scratch and swear.</p>

<p>Q: Yep, yep. Well, I guess Apple has made a difference after all.</p>

<p>A: That’s right.</p>

<p>Q: Be that as it may, Thunderbolt still isn’t going to ever be popular.</p>

<p>A: …I know.</p>

<p>This just in:</p>

<p>[![the graphic from the iPad event invite][2]][2]
No, I wasn’t invited. Why would I be invited? I’m a nobody, man. </p>

<p>Expect people all over the world to start ditching their iPads in preparation for new iPads, and expect Android tablets to start wondering why they’re not competitive anymore[1][2] .<br />
Expect Tim Cook to try to be somewhere near as cool as The Steve. Expect a large number of superlatives from Jony Ive about the new device. Expect me to start subtly begging for money so I can buy one of the blasted things. <br />
And, as always, expect a not-exactly-live post from me covering the event in hard-to-follow detail.</p>

<p>[]: http://crazyapplenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iPad-Invite-Graphic.jpg
 [2]: #footnote<em>0</em>1091 “not that they have ever really been competitive…”</p>

<p>We’ll be interviewing a current Gen iPad as soon as we find someone who is willing to let us talk to their iPad and not think it’s weird.</p>
