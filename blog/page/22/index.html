  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Many people were disappointed with the “startling” new revelations made at Macworld Expo yesterday, feeling that Phil Schiller, in addition to being forced to try to be Steve and forced to shut down Apple’s presence at Macworld, was also given a list of sub-par product announcements with which to do so, and that Apple shouldn’t be letting things slide like this.</p>

<p>But these people missed what was really going on.</p>

<p>It should have been obvious: <a href="http://www.macheist.com/">MacHeist 3</a> started the same day that Macworld Keynotes effectively ended. This in itself was the first clue. If you then took every third word that Phil said during the first ten minutes of the keynote<a href="#footnote_0_305" title="Three words for MH3, ten minutes for 10 years of Stevenotes">1</a>, then took the third letter of each of those words, you got the name of a website where you could download a program that would allow you to view the world in blue by using the iSight Camera in your laptop. Using this blue filter you could print out a copy of the text on the third forum page of comments on the Apple support site about replacing laptop batteries (see where this is going?) which would give you a link to a site that is disguised as a blog of a third grade teacher who comments that she isn’t aware of any new developments in school paste flavorings, but that she would be open to suggestions…</p>

<p>Look, it’s all very convoluted and MacHeisty. The point is, at the end of the trail you download an encrypted DMG file, and using the password “newBalance” you get a QuickTime movie of Steve Jobs in all his Mock Turtlenecked glory, standing on a stage in front of an empty Moscone West auditorium.</p>

<p>“MacHeisters, Welcome,” Steve begins, looking–for once–directly at the camera. “I know that you are wondering why I’m doing this, and why I pretty much hung Phil out to dry at the Macworld Keynote. You would no doubt like to know why I’m working with MacHeist to announce new products, instead of using more traditional channels.</p>

<p>“The reason for this is the rumor sites. They’ve been a little too sure of themselves for a little too long. Sure, most of them missed the new iLife thing, but let’s face it, that was small potatoes. As you watch this there’s a bunch of rumors site editors on the show floor at MacWorld, trying to act excited about yet another stupid-big MacBook Pro and some updates to iLife and iWork. Soon they’ll be heading back to their hotels, wondering how many double martinis they can charge to their expense accounts while pretending to be Tony Bennett. So they’re out of the way. Now I can tell you what Apple is <em>really</em> up to.”</p>

<p>Steve then clears his throat a little, and continues. “One: new minis: yes. The mac mini is an important part of the Mac lineup, and will move forward. Two: an Apple Tablet: yes, but not until after Snow Leopard. There is a good reason we are working on slimming down OSX and making all the technologies involved work more smoothly with less power. Three: iPhone nanos: no. Some little punk site already broke the real story on the so-called nanos, so go find that if you want to know what’s up there.</p>

<p>“And one more thing: a mid-size Apple Tower: Yes. The Mac Home will be a monitor-less Mac with expansion capabilities much like a Mac Pro, but aimed at advanced home users. Removing the monitor and using standard components will allow us to price the Mac Home roughly $300 lower than a comparable iMac, making the Mac Home an attractive option to PC switchers. </p>

<p>“Okay, now you know what’s up, agents. Your duty is to go out and loudly deride the rumors sites for missing such obvious announcements when they are made over the next few days. Oh, and solve all the other MacHeist missions that come your way. Seriously, the fate of the apple world relies on your ability to… oh, just go get some free software. Be well.” </p>

<p>With that the screen fades to black.</p>

  <p>It compliments for idea of the site. Also we are lovers of the trekking. Why we don’t organize an encounter of gotten passionate for of the excursions together? Even not more than 6-8 in all? A salute. </p>

<p>I think it works out to a compliment. Or an invitation to a crazy fling in Italy<a href="#footnote_1_296" title="the comment was originally in Italian.">2</a> with, er, 6-8 trekkies. Either way, It’s at least kinda complimentary. And kinda creepy.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Moltz finally admits that he’s left the pure world of Apple blogging in favor of <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1057">fear mongering</a>.  And frankly we here at CANS are shocked, shocked and offended that he would be running this shameful side project.  You can rest assured that CANS is our highest online priority, and that neither I nor any of the Ruby Ninja Androids would even think of running <a href="http://coals2newcastle.com">any other</a> <a href="http://natedickson.com">web</a> <a href="http://www.bookstore.utah.edu">sites</a>…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>With the new year all upon us and the festive celebrations dying down, it’s time to bend our somwhat bleary minds to the task of second-guessing Apple’s every move before they make it. Fortunately for us, nothing we write has any grounding in reality anyway, so we’re home free.</p>

<p>We predict that January’s Macworld will bring no less than a new Mac mini, iPod shuffle<a href="#footnote_0_293" title=" with the all-important “Genius” feature.">1</a>, iPhone 128GB with 4G support, and the startling move of the entire Mac OSX to the “cloud”, coupled with government regulation mandating that we stop making up new names for the internet before every word in English, French, Finnish and Tamil also means “The Internet”.<br />
“For Pete’s sake,” says the bill on page 23, Paragraph 8, section 7. “How many words do we need for a worldwide communication network?”</p>

<p>Concerns about Steve Jobs’ health will escalate to the point that Apple will create a cybernetic version of the mercurial CEO that will work every day in a glass office in downtown Cupertino. The deception will work perfectly until the robot accidentally crashes through the wall of the office and smashes to bits on the street below. This will in turn give rise to endless speculation about the length of Steve Jobs’ AppleCare coverage.</p>

<p>Phil Schiller will continue to rise in eminence in the company, ushering in a new age of Apple leadership, but also bringing back an old friend, by which I mean John Meyer. The iguana-faced singer will be elected to the board of directors after buying millions of shares in Apple on credit. He will then lose his seat when it turns out he can’t pay even the finance charges on the amount and his shares are repossesed. John will then be discraced and become the Richard Nixon of pop guitarists, while the new board member will be Al the Repo man. Al will resonate with the public and the company’s shares will skyrocket.</p>

<p>In more mundane news, John Gruber will continue to be irritable, Merlin Mann will write exactly four articles, and John Moltz will go in and out of retirement twice.</p>

<p>December will bring another round of changes to OSX, which, in response to changes in the computer ecosystem will be renamed “iPhone OS for Laptops.”</p>

<p>Quixotically, the following year will be renamed “20-OSX” at the urging of Nobel prize winner Al Gore and his collegue Al the Repo man.</p>

<p>Here’s to a very Mac new year!</p>

<p>News of a newer, smaller iPhone have been circulating on the web for what, days now.  So we here at CANS decided to do some undercover work to see what we could find out about our favorite trendsetting company’s plans to further revolutionize telecommunications.</p>

<p>Donning our best Steve Wozniak costume<a href="#footnote_0_290" title="which is identical to our best George Lucas costume, except for the Segway">1</a> we penetrated the outer defenses of the Apple Compound and were able to get to the inner sanctum. Well, the inner waiting room.  We made it past the secretary’s desk, anyway.</p>

<p>What was more surprising was that someone official actually decided to talk to us. In this case it was Scott Forestall, who is no less than SVP of iPhone software, and somewhat miffed that Schiller is speaking at Macworld instead of him.</p>

<p>“I mean, if Steve is gonna blow off the Mac community he should at least let me talk to the iPhone community,” Forestall whined.  “I could really connect with the people, but no, they’ll send Schiller because He’s Steve’s favorite.”</p>

<p>This went on for several more minutes.  After many ones of dollars and some carefully worded compliments<a href="#footnote_1_290" title="“Scott, everyone knows you’re the hippest of Apple’s  SVP’s.”">2</a> and sublte, indirect questions<a href="#footnote_2_290" title="“Hang on, my G1 is ringing. Man this thing is huge. Say, you aren’t planning on releasing a really small version of the iPhone are you?”">3</a> I was able to get him to admit the truth about the photos we’ve all seen on those disreputable rumors sites.</p>

<p>“No, those aren’t cheap knockoffs, like you think.  Oh, we’ve tried to play up that rumor, but really there’s no substance to it.  And they aren’t iPhone nanos, either. At least, not in the way you would think of it.</p>

<p>“You see, the iPhone is a triumph, a symbiosis of art and science; it’s a joining between phone, iPod and PDA.  But it’s more than that.  You can’t create something as perfect as the iPhone.  For that matter, you can’t manufacture them, either.  The truth is, iPhones are grown.”</p>

<p>We asked about this, being frankly stunned.  I mean, this sort of thing is plausible in Douglas Adams books, but not here in the real world, or even the internet.</p>

<p>“Each iPhone is grown on specially modified trees in China, where rules about genetic manipulation are less strict, and you can shoot trespassers, I mean, it’s easier to dissuade trespassers.  Anyway, the trees are normal Apple trees with some specific modifications made to their DNA, so that instead of apples they grow Apples, if you know what I mean.  And the iPhone nanos you’ve been seeing online are, well, under ripe specimens.”</p>

<p>“Like any fruit there are iPhones that don’t quite reach maturity before falling off the tree. They aren’t as good as fully ripe models; the interface is weaker and harder to use, the casing is flimsier, they just aren’t up to Apple’s standards. We do our best to recycle these “green” iPhones, but sometimes people sneak them off the farm before we can get to them.”</p>

<p>At this point the real Woz showed up and I had to get out of the building fast, but I was amazed at the sincerity in Mr. Forestall’s voice, and believe that we here at CANS have finally “scooped” the so-called “big boys” of the Apple news world, and have brought you the real truth, instead of some half-baked rumors.  I for one believe his story. After all, how likely is it that some cheap Taiwanese knock-off artist could make such exact copies of the iPhone in miniature?</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: Yojimbo, Bare Bones’ “dump it here, worry about it later” program</p>

<p>Q: I thought Yojimbo was supposed to be <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">so easy to use, there was no  learning curve</a>.</p>

<p>A: Oh, it is.  Yojimbo is easy to use and pretty darn amazing.</p>

<p>Q: But it apparently can’t help you figure out when Friday actually is.</p>

<p>A: That was uncalled for.</p>

<p>Q: So, if Yojimbo is so easy to use, why an iFAQ?</p>

<p>A: You gotta check this out: Look at the second picture on <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/tour-encryption.html">this page</a>!</p>

<p>Q: …An unencrypted note?</p>

<p>A: It’s <em>pure genius</em>, man! Underpants are pure genius!</p>

<p>Q: …</p>

<p>A: Isn’t that hilarious?  I bought the program <em>just because of that picture</em>.</p>

<p>Q: Really?</p>

<p>A: No, not really. I bought it because I kept losing serial numbers. But still, Have you ever seen such classic humor?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, it’s really great.</p>

<p>A: I know!  And you thought Bare Bones was all stodgy, old-school grumpy mac users.</p>

<p>Q: I never said that.  And what are you talking about? It’s the switchers that get grumpy!</p>

<p>A: You thought they were content to rest on their overpriced BBEdit laurels, without thinking of what that could do the rest of the community. Bet you feel pretty silly now, doncha, Mr. Condescending Question Asker?</p>

<p>Q: Overpriced what?</p>

<p>A: Yep, Bare Bones has shown you, once again, that they have what counts when little fly-by-night startups like <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> fall apart in the back stretch.  What’s that, TextMate? Can’t handle the jump to<a href="http://wiki.macromates.com/FAQ/TextMate2"> version 2.0</a>?  <a href="http://barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>‘s on version 9 and:</p>

<h3 id="it-doesnt-suck">It doesn’t suck.®</h3>

<p>How’s that taste, you Euro-snob?  Where’s your precious Ruby on Rails now?</p>

<p>Q: Is there any reason for me to be involved with this conversation any more?</p>

<p>A:  When others are taking a nap, Bare Bones is doing the Tango of Destiny with the Future, baby!</p>

<p>Q: Worst. Metaphor. Ever.</p>

<p>A: Well, you can go crawling back to your newfangled email clients and your GTD managers. I’m gonna make a <strong>3. Profit!</strong> with my homies at BB. Later, fool!</p>

<p>Q: “Tango of Destiny with the Future?”  Really?</p>

<p>So, ol’ <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1055">Moltz is coming out of retirement</a> for the Macworld Keynote, is he? Okay, I’ve been around a while. I got some chops. I got… about four followers. Whatever. It’s on. Me and Moltz, man to man, whoever writes the best coverage wins.</p>

<p>I should probably go buy my “thanks for beating me” card now.</p>

<p>Hey all,<br />
Macheist season is back again, and they’re kicking it off with the giving tree! If you don’t have a Macheist account yet, and wouldn’t mind having one, let me know and I’ll send you an invite. It gets you some free software and it gets me a little free software as well.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.<br />
This week: Stacks, Apple’s easy way to make a pile of stuff on the dock look…well, a lot like a pile of stuff on the dock.</p>

<p>Q: Help! Help! Helphelphelp! Help! Help1 Hlephelf help!</p>

<p>A: Sir, or possibly madam, calm down! You’re starting to type like a 9-year-old!</p>

<p>Q: AAAAAAAAAAaauuuugghh!</p>

<p>A: Now you’re a comic strip person.  What do you need?</p>

<p>Q: I [pant pant] need [pant] Steve!</p>

<p>A: I’m sorry?</p>

<p>Q: Steve Jobs! At Macworld! He’s not!</p>

<p>A: Ah. I see. And you-</p>

<p>Q: It’s a conspiracy, you know!</p>

<p>A: A consp…</p>

<p>Q: It’s a conspiracy between Apple and the Terrorist Hedgehogs to stop the Mac goodness from staying pure and unsullied!</p>

<p>A: The Terrorist Hedgehogs?<a href="#footnote_0_268" title="Would be a good name for a band.  Someone let Dave Barry know.">1</a></p>

<p>Q: Don’t play dumb.  You know all about the nefarious underground resistance fighters.</p>

<p>A: Are you just spouting random lines from B Sci-fi movies?</p>

<p>Q: And now they’ve undermined-</p>

<p>A: Good metaphor!</p>

<p>Q: -Macworld Expo and we have nothing left to live for! You know you were all excited about the “One More Thing” that was bound to happen this year!  Now what do we have to look forward to?</p>

<p>A: Actually I quite like Phil Schiller…</p>

<p>Q: <strong>PHIL FREAKIN’ SCHILLER!</strong> We all know what he’s going to talk about. Stupid iPod games.  <em>Again</em>.</p>

<p>A: That does seem likely…</p>

<p>Q: What about Snow Leopard? What about a new version of Time Machine? What about an iMac refresh?  You think Schiller’s gonna talk about these things?</p>

<p>A: There doesn’t seem to be any real reason for me to respond to you…</p>

<p>Q: What about revamping the dashboard into something useful?<a href="#footnote_1_268" title="Hint: this is not possible. -ed.">2</a> What about a brand new 64GB iPod Touch with a black bezel? What about a <strong><em>black mock turtleneck</em></strong>?</p>

<p>A: Hey now, we don’t speak in bold italics on this blog; tone that language down my friend.</p>

<p>Q: Now all of this has been defeated by those libertarian pro-llama red-wing defeatist pinbacks!</p>

<p>A: We also don’t allow, er, species-ist slurs on our blog.  I may have to ask you to leave.</p>

<p>Q: You would, you hedge-lover!</p>

<p>A: …</p>

<p>Q: It’s hard to find a good insult for someone who likes hedgehogs, alright?</p>

<p>A: I can see that.</p>

<p>Q: I mean, they’ve pretty much taken all the fun out of it at that point.</p>

<p>A: Yes.  Well, hopefully-</p>

<p>Q: Much like the Terrorist Hedgehogs have <strong><em>taken all the fun out of Macworld Expo</em></strong>!</p>

<p>A: Okay, I warned you about this already, you’re outta here, my friend.  Androids, if you please?</p>

<p>Q: You can’t silence the truth! I may be dragged kicking and screaming out of this iFAQ, but the truth will prevail! The hedgehogs are organized, and if we don’t act, we won’t have macs! You hedgehogs sympathizers must be stopped!</p>
