<p>I think it works out to a compliment. Or an invitation to a crazy fling in Italy<a href="#footnote_1_296" title="the comment was originally in Italian.">2</a> with, er, 6-8 trekkies. Either way, It’s at least kinda complimentary. And kinda creepy.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Moltz finally admits that he’s left the pure world of Apple blogging in favor of <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1057">fear mongering</a>.  And frankly we here at CANS are shocked, shocked and offended that he would be running this shameful side project.  You can rest assured that CANS is our highest online priority, and that neither I nor any of the Ruby Ninja Androids would even think of running <a href="http://coals2newcastle.com">any other</a> <a href="http://natedickson.com">web</a> <a href="http://www.bookstore.utah.edu">sites</a>…</p>

<p>With the new year all upon us and the festive celebrations dying down, it’s time to bend our somwhat bleary minds to the task of second-guessing Apple’s every move before they make it. Fortunately for us, nothing we write has any grounding in reality anyway, so we’re home free.</p>

<p>We predict that January’s Macworld will bring no less than a new Mac mini, iPod shuffle<a href="#footnote_0_293" title=" with the all-important “Genius” feature.">1</a>, iPhone 128GB with 4G support, and the startling move of the entire Mac OSX to the “cloud”, coupled with government regulation mandating that we stop making up new names for the internet before every word in English, French, Finnish and Tamil also means “The Internet”.<br />
“For Pete’s sake,” says the bill on page 23, Paragraph 8, section 7. “How many words do we need for a worldwide communication network?”</p>

<p>Concerns about Steve Jobs’ health will escalate to the point that Apple will create a cybernetic version of the mercurial CEO that will work every day in a glass office in downtown Cupertino. The deception will work perfectly until the robot accidentally crashes through the wall of the office and smashes to bits on the street below. This will in turn give rise to endless speculation about the length of Steve Jobs’ AppleCare coverage.</p>

<p>Phil Schiller will continue to rise in eminence in the company, ushering in a new age of Apple leadership, but also bringing back an old friend, by which I mean John Meyer. The iguana-faced singer will be elected to the board of directors after buying millions of shares in Apple on credit. He will then lose his seat when it turns out he can’t pay even the finance charges on the amount and his shares are repossesed. John will then be discraced and become the Richard Nixon of pop guitarists, while the new board member will be Al the Repo man. Al will resonate with the public and the company’s shares will skyrocket.</p>

<p>In more mundane news, John Gruber will continue to be irritable, Merlin Mann will write exactly four articles, and John Moltz will go in and out of retirement twice.</p>

<p>December will bring another round of changes to OSX, which, in response to changes in the computer ecosystem will be renamed “iPhone OS for Laptops.”</p>

<p>Quixotically, the following year will be renamed “20-OSX” at the urging of Nobel prize winner Al Gore and his collegue Al the Repo man.</p>

<p>Here’s to a very Mac new year!</p>

<p>News of a newer, smaller iPhone have been circulating on the web for what, days now.  So we here at CANS decided to do some undercover work to see what we could find out about our favorite trendsetting company’s plans to further revolutionize telecommunications.</p>

<p>Donning our best Steve Wozniak costume<a href="#footnote_0_290" title="which is identical to our best George Lucas costume, except for the Segway">1</a> we penetrated the outer defenses of the Apple Compound and were able to get to the inner sanctum. Well, the inner waiting room.  We made it past the secretary’s desk, anyway.</p>

<p>What was more surprising was that someone official actually decided to talk to us. In this case it was Scott Forestall, who is no less than SVP of iPhone software, and somewhat miffed that Schiller is speaking at Macworld instead of him.</p>

<p>“I mean, if Steve is gonna blow off the Mac community he should at least let me talk to the iPhone community,” Forestall whined.  “I could really connect with the people, but no, they’ll send Schiller because He’s Steve’s favorite.”</p>

<p>This went on for several more minutes.  After many ones of dollars and some carefully worded compliments<a href="#footnote_1_290" title="“Scott, everyone knows you’re the hippest of Apple’s  SVP’s.”">2</a> and sublte, indirect questions<a href="#footnote_2_290" title="“Hang on, my G1 is ringing. Man this thing is huge. Say, you aren’t planning on releasing a really small version of the iPhone are you?”">3</a> I was able to get him to admit the truth about the photos we’ve all seen on those disreputable rumors sites.</p>

<p>“No, those aren’t cheap knockoffs, like you think.  Oh, we’ve tried to play up that rumor, but really there’s no substance to it.  And they aren’t iPhone nanos, either. At least, not in the way you would think of it.</p>

<p>“You see, the iPhone is a triumph, a symbiosis of art and science; it’s a joining between phone, iPod and PDA.  But it’s more than that.  You can’t create something as perfect as the iPhone.  For that matter, you can’t manufacture them, either.  The truth is, iPhones are grown.”</p>

<p>We asked about this, being frankly stunned.  I mean, this sort of thing is plausible in Douglas Adams books, but not here in the real world, or even the internet.</p>

<p>“Each iPhone is grown on specially modified trees in China, where rules about genetic manipulation are less strict, and you can shoot trespassers, I mean, it’s easier to dissuade trespassers.  Anyway, the trees are normal Apple trees with some specific modifications made to their DNA, so that instead of apples they grow Apples, if you know what I mean.  And the iPhone nanos you’ve been seeing online are, well, under ripe specimens.”</p>

<p>“Like any fruit there are iPhones that don’t quite reach maturity before falling off the tree. They aren’t as good as fully ripe models; the interface is weaker and harder to use, the casing is flimsier, they just aren’t up to Apple’s standards. We do our best to recycle these “green” iPhones, but sometimes people sneak them off the farm before we can get to them.”</p>

<p>At this point the real Woz showed up and I had to get out of the building fast, but I was amazed at the sincerity in Mr. Forestall’s voice, and believe that we here at CANS have finally “scooped” the so-called “big boys” of the Apple news world, and have brought you the real truth, instead of some half-baked rumors.  I for one believe his story. After all, how likely is it that some cheap Taiwanese knock-off artist could make such exact copies of the iPhone in miniature?</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: Yojimbo, Bare Bones’ “dump it here, worry about it later” program</p>

<p>Q: I thought Yojimbo was supposed to be <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">so easy to use, there was no  learning curve</a>.</p>

<p>A: Oh, it is.  Yojimbo is easy to use and pretty darn amazing.</p>

<p>Q: But it apparently can’t help you figure out when Friday actually is.</p>

<p>A: That was uncalled for.</p>

<p>Q: So, if Yojimbo is so easy to use, why an iFAQ?</p>

<p>A: You gotta check this out: Look at the second picture on <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/tour-encryption.html">this page</a>!</p>

<p>Q: …An unencrypted note?</p>

<p>A: It’s <em>pure genius</em>, man! Underpants are pure genius!</p>

<p>Q: …</p>

<p>A: Isn’t that hilarious?  I bought the program <em>just because of that picture</em>.</p>

<p>Q: Really?</p>

<p>A: No, not really. I bought it because I kept losing serial numbers. But still, Have you ever seen such classic humor?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, it’s really great.</p>

<p>A: I know!  And you thought Bare Bones was all stodgy, old-school grumpy mac users.</p>

<p>Q: I never said that.  And what are you talking about? It’s the switchers that get grumpy!</p>

<p>A: You thought they were content to rest on their overpriced BBEdit laurels, without thinking of what that could do the rest of the community. Bet you feel pretty silly now, doncha, Mr. Condescending Question Asker?</p>

<p>Q: Overpriced what?</p>

<p>A: Yep, Bare Bones has shown you, once again, that they have what counts when little fly-by-night startups like <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> fall apart in the back stretch.  What’s that, TextMate? Can’t handle the jump to<a href="http://wiki.macromates.com/FAQ/TextMate2"> version 2.0</a>?  <a href="http://barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>‘s on version 9 and:</p>

<h3 id="it-doesnt-suck">It doesn’t suck.®</h3>

<p>How’s that taste, you Euro-snob?  Where’s your precious Ruby on Rails now?</p>

<p>Q: Is there any reason for me to be involved with this conversation any more?</p>

<p>A:  When others are taking a nap, Bare Bones is doing the Tango of Destiny with the Future, baby!</p>

<p>Q: Worst. Metaphor. Ever.</p>

<p>A: Well, you can go crawling back to your newfangled email clients and your GTD managers. I’m gonna make a <strong>3. Profit!</strong> with my homies at BB. Later, fool!</p>

<p>Q: “Tango of Destiny with the Future?”  Really?</p>

<p>News today of an unexpected user of the iPhone’s GPS technology has deeply disheartened the Android mob, which is a bunch of robots anyway, so what are they even doing with hearts in the first place?<br />
“I just like how easy it is to use,” said Saint Nick, in a phone interview December 23. “I put in the kids’ names and their addresses are pulled up on the map, and I can see how close I am to them. I mean, I’m sure the G1 is nice and all, but this is where it’s at.”</p>

<strong>Steve</strong>: That’s true. But you can still think different! And your difference can never be copied by anyone else. In fact, the other directors and I have written a little song to help you out! Ready guys?<br />
<strong>Directors</strong>:* [Half-hearted mumbling, someone says, “can’t I go home to my family yet?”]*<br />

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Deep in the Matrix-colored recesses of his Ballmer-Cave, the virus creator has brought forth his most devious weapon yet: a <em>malicious Excel Macro</em>! Unfortunately, it only works on PC’s with no antivirus running windows 98 or older. But it’s a step.</p>

<p>Q: What about revamping the dashboard into something useful?<a href="#footnote_1_268" title="Hint: this is not possible. -ed.">2</a> What about a brand new 64GB iPod Touch with a black bezel? What about a <strong><em>black mock turtleneck</em></strong>?</p>

<p>A: Hey now, we don’t speak in bold italics on this blog; tone that language down my friend.</p>

<p>Q: Now all of this has been defeated by those libertarian pro-llama red-wing defeatist pinbacks!</p>

<p>A: We also don’t allow, er, species-ist slurs on our blog.  I may have to ask you to leave.</p>

<p>Q: You would, you hedge-lover!</p>

<p>A: …</p>

<p>Q: It’s hard to find a good insult for someone who likes hedgehogs, alright?</p>

<p>A: I can see that.</p>

<p>Q: I mean, they’ve pretty much taken all the fun out of it at that point.</p>

<p>A: Yes.  Well, hopefully-</p>

<p>Q: Much like the Terrorist Hedgehogs have <strong><em>taken all the fun out of Macworld Expo</em></strong>!</p>

<p>A: Okay, I warned you about this already, you’re outta here, my friend.  Androids, if you please?</p>

<p>Q: You can’t silence the truth! I may be dragged kicking and screaming out of this iFAQ, but the truth will prevail! The hedgehogs are organized, and if we don’t act, we won’t have macs! You hedgehogs sympathizers must be stopped!</p>

<p>Panic gripped the Mac community today as startling evidence of Apple’s loss of confidence amongst the younger crowd was evidenced.</p>

<p>“Nintendo is more cooler than the iPhone,” said Timmy, age 10.</p>

<p>“This is catastrophic, this is more than I can handle,” wailed Leo Laporte, mostly because we haven’t made up used any quotes from him in a while. “If 10-year-olds don’t like iPhones, they won’t grow up to use Mac Pros! If they don’t grow up to use Mac Pros, the only other thing they could be using is (Da da DAAAAAAAH) Windows Computers!” We weren’t previously aware that Mr. Laporte did all his own sound effects.</p>

<p>“Macs are lame, too,” Timmy was also reported to say. “I can’t even play lame old games like GTA 2 on my brother’s Mac.  All it can play is Spore, and that’s stupid.”</p>

<p>Apple has been quick to point out that they are working hard to connect with today’s youth through the use of poor grammar like “the funnest iPod ever” and that the opinion of one person doesn’t mean the whole world thinks that way, but the Mac Community had stopped listening at that point.  This is partially because nearly every Apple pundit was simultaneously offering Timmy candy if he would say he likes iPhones, but partially because this is the sort of rumor that you don’t just wait around for verification on before you start panicking.</p>

<p>“First Macworld gets the finger, and now Apple’s losing 10-year-olds.  Yep, looks like that ol’ Apple will be ripe for the pickin’ when Windows 7 rolls around,” said Rob Enderle, inexplicably dressed in overalls and a straw hat. “Yessir, they had a fair-to-middlin’ summer, but looks like ol’ autumn will be here soon and we all be havin’ some fresh apple sauce with our Sunday roast.”  His analogy got even more strained at this point, and frankly, we were too busy panicking to try and figure the rest of it out.</p>

<p>Apple may or may not have refused to comment, we aren’t sure. We were busy buying iTunes gift cards for all the 10 year olds we know, just to be on the safe side.</p>
