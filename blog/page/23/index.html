<p>When we learned that Microsoft had created <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/softwearbymicrosoft/story/">a line of “retro” t-shirts</a>, we had some difficult questions to answer.</p>

<p>The first of which was not, “do we make fun of Microsoft for this odd new advertising medium/revenue stream?” Of course we’re going to make fun of them for it.  That’s a given.  No, the question is “how are we going to make fun of Microsoft for this odd new advertising medium/revenue stream?”</p>

<p>I mean, we could take the obvious route: “These t-shirts crash 30% less than Windows Vista! Just like DOS!”</p>

<p>Or the closely related: “And unlike DOS, these shirts are guaranteed to be bug-free!”</p>

<p>Or even: “These shirts are guaranteed to {expletive deleted} destroy Google!”</p>

<p>And we decided to step around the whole “Softwear by Microsoft: celebrating the last time we made an OS that worked the way it was supposed to,” territory.</p>

<p>None of these are the route we decided to take.  No, we have a much higher, more subtle method of mocking the largest, most influential, most myopic software company in the world in mind.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to this RSS feed to see what we did come up with!</p>

<p>And no, we aren’t going to Photoshop Steve Ballmer’s head onto the body of some twenty-year-old model who is wearing one of these shirts.  So just get that image out of your head right now.</p>

<p>And so, having helped Steve Jobs and the Internet save our Macs from infection, I find myself flat on my back, having lost to a regular ol’ analog people-virus. Thanks to my team of Androids I can still post, however. If I get delusional later I’ll try to write something. Those posts are usually pretty funny. At least, I <em>think</em> they are…</p>

<p><strong>Newswire (AP) Dateline-the Internet</strong>: On this day, December 7th, at exactly 7:07 PM, an almost-unknown Apple satirist turned 31.</p>

<p>Several sources also reported hearing “a disturbance in the ‘Net, as if millions of viruses suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Deep in Cupertino, there is an office.  It is sparsely furnished; a few chairs for guests, a few original masterpieces on the walls, and in the middle of the room, an exquisitely designed desk.  It is made of brushed aluminum, but the top is a single sheet of glass with a 1-inch black bezel all around it.  The rest is a screen/multi-touch pad combination.  Here is the most advanced computer bar Deep Thought.  Here is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Here is the SteveMac.</p>

<p>a lone Safari window shines out amid the dark desk.  Steve is reading his favorite news/satire site, smiling at the amateur wit and clumsy requests for money.  He clicks on the next article and learns of the coming Mac Apocalypse.  He frowns slightly and checks a few other sites on the web just for verification.  It seems to be true.</p>

<p>He sighs, puts both hands just above the smooth glass of his desk with the look of a master pianist, and performs the only six-finger gesture.  his desk goes dark and is divided into a grid of iChat windows, each with a code name across the bottom.  Soon faces start appearing behind the code names.  The box labeled “Wizard” contains the bespectacled features of Merlin Mann.  Leo Laporte’s affable face can be seen smiling out from the one labeled “Lion”  David Pogue is “New Yorker”, and looking grim, irratated, and remarkably smug is John Gruber, Codename: Fireball.<a href="#footnote_0_247" title="Bloggers, as a rule, enjoy anonymity almost as much as cats enjoy a long, hot soak in the tub.">1</a> In one unregarded corner of the desk one box remains dark, and it seems it will never light up again.  Codename: The Entity.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I need your help,” Steve begins, and he quickly explains the situation.  “The time is not right.  I need all of you to go out and discount the myth.  Strengthen our position, and if you can convince people that they could use AV without spreading panic, so much the better.  But the main thing is to stop the rumor of Mac vulnerability; not the reality.  I’ll take care of that. Understood?”  The codenamed agents agree, and Steve closes the window.</p>

<p>There, he has done what was needed. But is it enough?  He thinks for a minute, raises both hands again, and performs the Ten Finger Gesture on his desktop.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, then faster and faster, web pages appear on his desktop.  An eBay auction.  The Google Homepage.  A Facebook profile.  Twitter. Digg.  Amazon. A Star Wars/Ninja Turtles crossover fanfic. MySpace. Yahoo!.  A webcomic about elves. World of Warcraft. Pandora.</p>

<p>As each new page appears the ones already there shrink and re-adjust to allow the new one space.  The entire desk becomes a shifting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">mosaic</a> of stories, retailers, angsty teenage LiveJournals, and all the other things that make the Internet what it is.  Suddenly it no longer appears as a mass of webpages, but seen altogether they become a face, petulant, exuberant, clever, and moody. This is the Face of the Internet.</p>

<p>“Why have you called me?” it asks.</p>

<p>“I need your help.” Steve replies.</p>

<p>“I know.  What’s in it for me?”</p>

<p>“Internet Explorer is under 90% share again.  Doesn’t that make you happy?”</p>

<p>The Internet laughs.  “Yes, I know.  It does, but that was the work of my pet Firefox much more than your WebKit.  Oh, I appreciate your efforts, but if you want me to help you stop the Mac Apocalypse you’ll need to do better than that.”</p>

<p>The Internet’s face is expectant, pushing for a bargain like the millions of eBay shoppers that power it, but patient as the Wikipedia link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Branson_School_in_Ross,_CA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Branson School in Ross, CA (page does not exist)">The Branson School in Ross, CA</a>, waiting for someone to write an article about it.</p>

<p>Steve pauses, then says, “I think I can accelerate the adoption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>.  I have a plan…”</p>

<p>As he explains his plan the Internet looks first curious, then excited, then eager.  “Yes. Do that for me, and I will stop the Mac Apocalypse.  Thank you, Steve. We have a deal.”  With that, the face disappears, and Steve sits back in his chair, but only for a moment.  It’s time to get to work.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: how to deal with Mac Viruses</p>

<p>Q: I seem to have a virus on my Mac.  How do I get rid of it?</p>

<p>A: Mmmm-hmmm.  So, you got a virus, huh?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, I guess so.</p>

<p>A:  And where were you when you picked up this little “virus”?</p>

<p>Q: Uhhh, at home?</p>

<p>A: At home, but checkin’ out someone else’s homepage, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Q: Wha?</p>

<p>A: We all know <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=629">where Mac Viruses come from</a>, don’t we?</p>

<p>Q: What are you saying?</p>

<p>A: Oh, nothing, nothing.  What you do in your free time is your business, prevert.  Still, we have to help you if we’re going to prevent the Mac Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Q: The what?</p>

<p>A: Okay, here’s what you do to get rid of the virus:</p>

<p>Q: Don’t you want to know what virus it is?</p>

<p>A: First, you apologize to your Mac for taking it “off road”, so to speak…</p>

<p>Q: Apologize to my computer?</p>

<p>A: YES! Macs are very sensitive.  Second, you buy your Mac something nice, like a new mouse. Or maybe a USB hub. A new Time Machine drive is a thoughtful, sensitive gift.</p>

<p>Q: Well, I could use an external hard drive I guess…</p>

<p>A: It isn’t for you! It’s for your Mac.  Don’t be so selfish.  Third, you chant the incantation against the Mac Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Q: I don’t know the incantation against…</p>

<p>A: “Oh great Steve, protect us from the anti-Steve!”  Is that so hard?</p>

<p>Q: O-Okay…</p>

<p>A: and last, you just <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2007/10/firstlooks/trojanhorse/index.php">follow these steps</a>.  There! You’re virus free.  Now go and sin no more.</p>

<p>Q: Couldn’t I just…</p>

<p>A: The steps to cleanliness are non-negotiable! Screw this up and soon we’ll all need AV software crapping up our systems.  Do you want that on your head? Do you?</p>

<p>Q: No! I’ll do the steps! I’ll be clean!</p>

<p>A: Good.  Another Mac saved.  And in the nick of time, too. because the Mac Apocalypse is right around the corner<img src="#footnote_0_237" title="Dun dun daaaaaaaaaaah!" alt="1" /></p>

<p>He sits in a darkened room, the moon high above the cedars outside his home, somewhere in the great northwest.  Lines of green letters play across his face.  This is because he left the room to go get some more Cheetos, and his “The Matrix” screen saver had kicked in.  Moving the mouse he shudders slightly as his “Windows Vista” desktop comes back into view.  Okay, now, back to work.</p>

<p>“Developers, developers, developers,” he mutters under his breath as he seeks to write the virus that will finally bring those smug Mac users to their knees.  Sweating profusely, he returns to his Visual Basic code window.</p>

<p>This had started out so simple; and if Jeff Goldblum can write a virus on a Power Book that infects an alien mothership, why couldn’t our unnamed hacker write a perfect Mac virus on Windows? in Visual Basic?</p>

<p>“Come on, Steve! You can do this!” he says to himself, but his progress is still slow.   He’d developed his payload<a href="#footnote_0_232" title="a screen that says, “Macs are statistically insignificant!”">1</a> and his method of delivery<a href="#footnote_1_232" title="attaching the virus to an email with the subject, “Pass this on to all your friends for free money!">2</a> but for some reason, no matter how he re-formatted his code, whenever he tried to run it on the hated Mac Mini sitting on the corner of his desk it just…ignores his virus.  This is getting frustrating, and running a hand over his bald scalp he realizes that he’s just spread Cheetos dust all over his noggin again.  Sighing, he gets up and heads back to the shower.  His time will come, even if he has to pay a thousand corrupt bloggers to bring it about, even if he has buy all the botnets in North America to find the answer. The Mac Apocalypse is at hand, as sure as his name is Ste…</p>

<p>A crash of thunder shakes the windows as his “The Matrix” screensaver bathes the room in green light.</p>

<p>Apple has admitted that millions upon millions of viruses are targeted at the Mac operating system, and that every Mac, from the humblest Mini to the greatest Mac Pro to the lightest MacBook Air will soon be a drooling mass of spambots and DDoS attacker clones.</p>

<p>Well, actually they <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2550">encouraged</a> “the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent, thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult.”</p>

<p>But this minor distinction should not stop us from engaging in large-scale, wholesale panic.  It’s the end of an era, people, and viruses or not, we are going to start getting snobby comments from long-standing (long-suffering?) Windows users.  Again. And more this time.</p>

<p>“Yeah, how do you like that, hippies?” said Rob Enderle, apparently channeling the spirit of Richard Nixon.  “The shoe’s on the other foot now, isn’t it?  Your precious Steve Jobs didn’t save you from the virii in the world, because he can’t!  We’ll get you yet!  You won’t have Rob Enderle to kick around any more!”<a href="#footnote_0_228" title="This rant funded by the Symantec Corporation">1</a> While syntactically null, this statement goes to further demonstrate the inherent instability of a personality that would deliberately use the word “virii”.</p>

<p>Enderle to one side, now it’s time to start doing pathological system checks, study each and every file in your “Systems” folder, and send emails frothing with exclamation points warning users not to click on icons that look like teddy bears.  Just like the old days, when we used Windows 98.  Remember those days?  Weren’t they great?</p>

<p>Now, I know there are naysayers out there that claim that, with a negligible number of actual live exploits and a better-than-average schedule of system updates and security patches, coupled with a solid Unix foundation, the Mac is not exactly the virus hotel that Windows has become.  But this is just the kind of self-satisfied hubris that is likely to bring the Mac community crashing to the ground in a matter of days as the Mac Apocalypse strikes.  On December 7.  At 7:07 PM.   Which it will do without warning.</p>

<p>Thus far, the news of the Mac Apocalypse has not been widely heeded, and despite Apple’s empassioned pleas for all users to try and thwart this wave of nightmarish evil with the sacrifice of just a few thousand clock cycles per second,<a href="#footnote_1_228" title="their exact words are, “Here are some available antivirus utilities:”">2</a> most people say that they “wouldn’t install an anti-virus program on their Mac even if it also played <a href="http://www.womgames.com/index.php">Snood</a> and any two Pangea games of your choice.” <a href="#footnote_2_228" title="What is this obsession with Snood, anyway?  It’s really not a very good game at all.  But every Mac user I know who got on the Mac train before Tiger seems to play it.">3</a> Well fine.  That’s your choice.  Just don’t come cryin’ to us when you get p0wned by some 13-year-old Somali computer pirate.  Because we won’t be able to read your emails.  We’re not installing AV software either.</p>

<p>You know how, when they release movie trailers, sometimes they put all the best parts of the movie into the trailer?  This isn’t one of those kinds.  This is a scene that wasn’t working out at all, draft after draft, and  I needed to move on.  The version you see here is nothing like what will be in the novel, but I had fun writing it and thought you might enjoy it.</p>

<p>Oh, and “Guard” and “Big Mama” <em>are</em> their names.  The main character is Jason. This starts out from his point of view, and switches to Guard a little way in.</p>

<h2>Guard’s Story: Act III</h2>

<p>Guard was already seated when I got there, so I sat down facing him,  and noticed how little it hurt to do things like sit down and move around these days.  I was almost whole again!  But now was not the time to worry about my side.  Guard was going to tell me what had happened next, and I was more than ready to find out.<br/>
He waited until I was comfortably seated, then began.</p>

<p>I was not popular around the village after that. (Guard said.)  The raid had been particularly savage, and the raiders had made it known that they were after me and my new little ideas.  Many accused me of wasting time talking when I could have spent that time breaking more of our attackers’ faces.  Many accused me of inviting their wrath in my pride, and my bad attitude.  I said that they were welcome to do what they thought best, and that all I had ever done was work for the good of the village, but nobody wanted to hear that again.<br/>
I really didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t want to go back to raiding, because I couldn’t see how it was right to take from others what we could get for ourselves.  I didn’t want to give up my studies for war training.<br/>
I wasn’t getting anywhere, and I knew that I wouldn’t, so long as I was trying to figure things out on my own.  I knew someone who could help, but I really, really didn’t want to go to her for help.  Still, I had no other option.  I went and found the fat bossy lady from the other village.<br/>
She was sitting outside her house, looking pleased with herself as usual, and not doing a whole lot.  When she saw me coming she nodded, then waited for me to take a seat before talking.<br/>
“So, people aren’t as easy to please as you thought. And sometimes you need to hit someone a little bit. The question is; what are you going to do about it?  How do you propose to handle your little problem?”<br/>
“I don’t know.”<br/>
“What did I tell you last time?”<br/>
“Something about pure force.  What happened to intelligence?”<br/>
“You need to know where to push, sure, but some things won’t go away by talking.  Sometimes you need to act. Sometimes what you do won’t work, but at least you will have tried.”<br/>
“This part of the story isn’t very easy to write, is it?”<br/>
“No, son, this part is getting pretty sticky and hard to get moving on at all.”<br/>
I looked at her for a second. Things weren’t going the way we expected.<br/>
“What should we do to make things work better?”<br/>
“Well, the Author’s had a hard enough time; why don’t we skip ahead to the real point of this scene, and go from there? And on the way, we’ll summarize what we are supposed to say in this section!”<br/>
I liked the way she was thinking.  It would get us out of a terribly slow and convoluted part of the story.  We started walking through the plot, ignoring narrative theory, and talking over what we should have been doing.<br/>
“So, Guard, here’s the part where you try to turn away from your true path, once again.”<br/>
“Yep. Here’s where you remind me of what I’m meant to be, and what I can do to really make myself what I’m supposed to be.  I mean, you know, where you tell me about protecting those who need it, moving against the evils that beset us all, and what I can do to use my brain to carefully and properly direct my force.”<br/>
“Oogh, I forgot about this part.  Why did you fight me so hard, anyway?”<br/>
I grinned a little, something I wouldn’t do in story.  “I didn’t want to believe that my whole purpose in life is to hit people.”<br/>
“Well, you’ve learned better by the time the story picks up, right?”<br/>
“Well, I’m still brooding, you see.  I’m angry, frustrated, and I want to know that I can do more.  I mean, look at this fight scene.  I don’t even remember it; because I’m berserk in that scene.” I watched for a moment. “I got some good hits in though, didn’t I?”<br/>
“That’s my Guard!” Big Mama laughed.  “Oh, be careful, you almost tripped over the burning building, where you weren’t able to save the crops.”<br/>
“I sure did.  That scene is some pretty rough ground. It could use some work before it’s really ready to be in any book.  I mean, burning crops? What is the Author thinking?”<br/>
“Well, as long as it makes the end symbolic, that’s fine.” She responded warmly, mostly so you could remember who was saying what.<br/>
“Okay, so, here we are at the beach where you decide to come with me, be my bodyguard, and learn the true and right uses of who you are and what you do. Are you ready to get back into the story line?” She asked.  I sighed.<br/>
“Okay. I don’t like this scene, but the Author just marked this whole section as a “crappy draft”, so we can at least rest in the knowledge that it’ll be changed before too long.”<br/>
“Thank goodness. Okay, places everyone!” Big Mama said, then we stepped back into the story line.  It tingled.</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>|**</p>

<p>“So, kid, what’s it gonna be? You gonna stay on this island and hate yourself for fighting off attackers, or are you gonna come with me and learn how to do what needs done when it needs done?”</p>

<p>“Do I have a choice?”“Of course.  You always have a choice.  You can be a nobody or you can be your best self. It’s up to you. It always has been.”I sighed.  She was right.  I knew there was more for me out there with her than there was here, fighting people I didn’t want to fight for causes I didn’t believe in.  I stepped onto the ship, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Ta-daaa!  I should be done in time, without even stretching too much. Oh, and the fourth wall stays completely intact in the real novel, don’t worry.  No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie's_World">post-modernism</a> here! Thanks again for your support!</p>
