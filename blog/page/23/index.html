<p>Panic gripped the Mac community today as startling evidence of Apple’s loss of confidence amongst the younger crowd was evidenced.</p>

<p>“Nintendo is more cooler than the iPhone,” said Timmy, age 10.</p>

<p>“This is catastrophic, this is more than I can handle,” wailed Leo Laporte, mostly because we haven’t made up used any quotes from him in a while. “If 10-year-olds don’t like iPhones, they won’t grow up to use Mac Pros! If they don’t grow up to use Mac Pros, the only other thing they could be using is (Da da DAAAAAAAH) Windows Computers!” We weren’t previously aware that Mr. Laporte did all his own sound effects.</p>

<p>“Macs are lame, too,” Timmy was also reported to say. “I can’t even play lame old games like GTA 2 on my brother’s Mac.  All it can play is Spore, and that’s stupid.”</p>

<p>Apple has been quick to point out that they are working hard to connect with today’s youth through the use of poor grammar like “the funnest iPod ever” and that the opinion of one person doesn’t mean the whole world thinks that way, but the Mac Community had stopped listening at that point.  This is partially because nearly every Apple pundit was simultaneously offering Timmy candy if he would say he likes iPhones, but partially because this is the sort of rumor that you don’t just wait around for verification on before you start panicking.</p>

<p>“First Macworld gets the finger, and now Apple’s losing 10-year-olds.  Yep, looks like that ol’ Apple will be ripe for the pickin’ when Windows 7 rolls around,” said Rob Enderle, inexplicably dressed in overalls and a straw hat. “Yessir, they had a fair-to-middlin’ summer, but looks like ol’ autumn will be here soon and we all be havin’ some fresh apple sauce with our Sunday roast.”  His analogy got even more strained at this point, and frankly, we were too busy panicking to try and figure the rest of it out.</p>

<p>Apple may or may not have refused to comment, we aren’t sure. We were busy buying iTunes gift cards for all the 10 year olds we know, just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs today was forced to admit the truth: Apple is really terrible for the environment.</p>

<p>Based on an <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/137552/2008/12/ceres_report.html?lsrc=rss_weblogs_macuser">unknown list of criteria</a>, yet another watchdog group has lambasted Apple for being just really, really terrible for the environment compared to such upstanding companies as Dell and Tesco, which I would know more about if I lived in England.</p>

<p>“You got me,” Jobs said in a private phone call to Ceres headquarters that we may or may not have wiretapped.<a href="#footnote_0_263" title="Using Wiretap pro, which we got from MacHeist II last year.">1</a> “We are actually burning down three acres of rain forest for every iPod Touch we sell.  It’s not even part of the manufacturing process or anything, we just really hate any tree that doesn’t produce Apples.” Jobs said, inciting profuse whining from the party on the other end of the line.</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” quoth Jobs, “all that stuff about ‘going green’, reducing our carbon footprint, making our systems more recyclable, and being open about our systems? All false.  We still use coal and steam to stamp out the new MacBook cases.  How did you ever catch us, Granola Joe?”  His tone suggested that he was not being entirely sincere at this point.</p>

<p>“Wght, shertgsh, hurgl… I gotta go lie down!” was all we could get from John Gruber on this topic. One assumes that he’s having another heart attack, but you can see his point.</p>

<p>In a surprise counter attack, we were unavailable for comment this time when Apple tried to reach us for a statement.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>.</p>

<p>Q: Greetings, master.  I seek the benefit of your wisdom.</p>

<p>A: Approach, son, and I shall impart.</p>

<p>Q: I just got a new Mac, and I love it.</p>

<p>A: Truly, you have started on the path of wisdom.</p>

<p>Q: Yet there’s a problem.  I don’t feel pretentious enough when I open my programs.</p>

<p>A: Explain, my son, and the pretense you seek may soon be granted.</p>

<p>Q: Well, I bought all the most self-congratulatory  Mac-only apps I can think of, like <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>, and <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, and <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a>…</p>

<p>A: You have chosen well.  In choosing two over hyped text editors and a program that shows you pictures of books you already own, you have embraced all that is most pretentious in the Mac community.</p>

<p>Q: …But when I open them, I have to click on the icon like some kind of 20th Century Windows user.</p>

<p>A: Indeed.  And you seek a way to show your Windows using friends that your Mac skills are beyond their comprehension, while at the same time demonstrating your Mac to be the key of effortless computing.</p>

<p>Q: Yes, master.</p>

<p>A: I can help you my son.  You shall achieve the pomposity you desire, but it comes at a cost.</p>

<p>Q: I will pay any price, if I may only show myself better than the sons of Gates.</p>

<p>A: The price you will pay will not be in money, for the key to your arrogance is free-as-in-free-beer, but we will speak more of the price later.  The key of which I speak is Quicksilver.</p>

<p>Q: Tell me more, for I crave the mastery of this mercurial software.</p>

<p>A: Quicksilver allows you to launch, browse, change, transform, move, edit, tweak, and inspect all parts of your system with ninja-like skill and ease, with but a few taps on the keyboard.  Indeed, a true user of Quicksilver need scarce touch the mouse again.  Yet all this power is wrapped in an interface as graceful as the fall of a lotus blossom to the face of the waiting pond.</p>

<p>Q: Where may I find this potent blossom?</p>

<p>A: Seek the black tree, and look to the roots.  Quicksilver may be found there.</p>

<p>Q: I shall do so master.  But you spoke of the price.  I would know what recompense I should prepare for the master of the black tree.</p>

<p>A: As I said before, my son, the price is not one of gold nor even of PayPal funds, but, much like the tree that must bend that it may not break, you must sacrifice your pride that you may further elevate it.</p>

<p>Q: What then is this terrible price?</p>

<p>A: Quicksilver is no longer actively developed, and you must therefore <em>be content with software that isn’t updated every other week</em>!</p>

<p>Q: Aaaaaagh!  This indeed is a price beyond compare!  How may my pride and arrogance survive in the face of such adversity?</p>

<p>A: That, my son, is up to you, but as you master your pride so shall you master all others.  Also, it has this cool feature that makes words show up, like, really big on the screen!</p>

<p>Q: Hey, sweet!</p>

<p>Rumors of Apple launching a new line of “retro” t-shirts have frustrated the plans of software giant Microsoft.</p>

<p>“Awwww, crap,” said Ray Ozzie, Microsoft’s CSA. “This isn’t going to be another iPod/Zune thing is it?  It is, isn’t it?  We’re going to lose our, er, shirts to Apple, <em>again</em>, because somehow they’re going to come up with some cool rainbow-apple logo shirts that make all our DOS shirts look like something you’d use to clean up after the dog.  And we were even first this time.”</p>

<p>The 80′s style retro tees are indeed rumored to lean strongly on the rainbow apple, as well as the “happy mac” icon and original finder icon.</p>

<p>“We feel that these are symbols of people’s first contact with good computers,” said David Pogue, who just likes to get in the middle of everything, whether it concerns him or not. “They’ll bring back memories of playing “Oregon Trail” with graphics, and these are memories that will help sustain people through the hard economic times ahead.  Or you could get a t-shirt with Bill Gates’ mug shot on it.  It’s up to you, really.”</p>

<p>“No, seriously,” said Ozzie.  “We came up with the whole ’80′s retro shirt’ thing, and we should at least get a couple of months to try to sell them before Apple comes along and craps it up for us.  Whenever we try to get anything out the door that’s even a little bit ‘trendy’ or ‘cool’, they just come along and blast us right outta the water.  This is a prime example of ‘Vista Bullying’ all over again, you know that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The Linux community, ever quick to jump on the bandwagon, announced their own ’80s retro look, then had a good laugh at themselves when they remembered that Linus Torvalds didn’t create Linux until 1991, and that Tux the penguin has been pretty much the same ever since that time.</p>

<p>Apple has refused to confirm or deny the rumors, but they did wink at us and put on a pair of smoked-glass aviator-style shades.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>When we learned that Microsoft had created <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/softwearbymicrosoft/story/">a line of “retro” t-shirts</a>, we had some difficult questions to answer.</p>

<p>The first of which was not, “do we make fun of Microsoft for this odd new advertising medium/revenue stream?” Of course we’re going to make fun of them for it.  That’s a given.  No, the question is “how are we going to make fun of Microsoft for this odd new advertising medium/revenue stream?”</p>

<p>I mean, we could take the obvious route: “These t-shirts crash 30% less than Windows Vista! Just like DOS!”</p>

<p>Or the closely related: “And unlike DOS, these shirts are guaranteed to be bug-free!”</p>

<p>Or even: “These shirts are guaranteed to {expletive deleted} destroy Google!”</p>

<p>And we decided to step around the whole “Softwear by Microsoft: celebrating the last time we made an OS that worked the way it was supposed to,” territory.</p>

<p>None of these are the route we decided to take.  No, we have a much higher, more subtle method of mocking the largest, most influential, most myopic software company in the world in mind.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to this RSS feed to see what we did come up with!</p>

<p>And no, we aren’t going to Photoshop Steve Ballmer’s head onto the body of some twenty-year-old model who is wearing one of these shirts.  So just get that image out of your head right now.</p>

<p>And so, having helped Steve Jobs and the Internet save our Macs from infection, I find myself flat on my back, having lost to a regular ol’ analog people-virus. Thanks to my team of Androids I can still post, however. If I get delusional later I’ll try to write something. Those posts are usually pretty funny. At least, I <em>think</em> they are…</p>

<p>Deep in Cupertino, there is an office.  It is sparsely furnished; a few chairs for guests, a few original masterpieces on the walls, and in the middle of the room, an exquisitely designed desk.  It is made of brushed aluminum, but the top is a single sheet of glass with a 1-inch black bezel all around it.  The rest is a screen/multi-touch pad combination.  Here is the most advanced computer bar Deep Thought.  Here is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Here is the SteveMac.</p>

<p>a lone Safari window shines out amid the dark desk.  Steve is reading his favorite news/satire site, smiling at the amateur wit and clumsy requests for money.  He clicks on the next article and learns of the coming Mac Apocalypse.  He frowns slightly and checks a few other sites on the web just for verification.  It seems to be true.</p>

<p>He sighs, puts both hands just above the smooth glass of his desk with the look of a master pianist, and performs the only six-finger gesture.  his desk goes dark and is divided into a grid of iChat windows, each with a code name across the bottom.  Soon faces start appearing behind the code names.  The box labeled “Wizard” contains the bespectacled features of Merlin Mann.  Leo Laporte’s affable face can be seen smiling out from the one labeled “Lion”  David Pogue is “New Yorker”, and looking grim, irratated, and remarkably smug is John Gruber, Codename: Fireball.<a href="#footnote_0_247" title="Bloggers, as a rule, enjoy anonymity almost as much as cats enjoy a long, hot soak in the tub.">1</a> In one unregarded corner of the desk one box remains dark, and it seems it will never light up again.  Codename: The Entity.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I need your help,” Steve begins, and he quickly explains the situation.  “The time is not right.  I need all of you to go out and discount the myth.  Strengthen our position, and if you can convince people that they could use AV without spreading panic, so much the better.  But the main thing is to stop the rumor of Mac vulnerability; not the reality.  I’ll take care of that. Understood?”  The codenamed agents agree, and Steve closes the window.</p>

<p>There, he has done what was needed. But is it enough?  He thinks for a minute, raises both hands again, and performs the Ten Finger Gesture on his desktop.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, then faster and faster, web pages appear on his desktop.  An eBay auction.  The Google Homepage.  A Facebook profile.  Twitter. Digg.  Amazon. A Star Wars/Ninja Turtles crossover fanfic. MySpace. Yahoo!.  A webcomic about elves. World of Warcraft. Pandora.</p>

<p>As each new page appears the ones already there shrink and re-adjust to allow the new one space.  The entire desk becomes a shifting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">mosaic</a> of stories, retailers, angsty teenage LiveJournals, and all the other things that make the Internet what it is.  Suddenly it no longer appears as a mass of webpages, but seen altogether they become a face, petulant, exuberant, clever, and moody. This is the Face of the Internet.</p>

<p>“Why have you called me?” it asks.</p>

<p>“I need your help.” Steve replies.</p>

<p>“I know.  What’s in it for me?”</p>

<p>“Internet Explorer is under 90% share again.  Doesn’t that make you happy?”</p>

<p>The Internet laughs.  “Yes, I know.  It does, but that was the work of my pet Firefox much more than your WebKit.  Oh, I appreciate your efforts, but if you want me to help you stop the Mac Apocalypse you’ll need to do better than that.”</p>

<p>The Internet’s face is expectant, pushing for a bargain like the millions of eBay shoppers that power it, but patient as the Wikipedia link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Branson_School_in_Ross,_CA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Branson School in Ross, CA (page does not exist)">The Branson School in Ross, CA</a>, waiting for someone to write an article about it.</p>

<p>Steve pauses, then says, “I think I can accelerate the adoption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>.  I have a plan…”</p>

<p>As he explains his plan the Internet looks first curious, then excited, then eager.  “Yes. Do that for me, and I will stop the Mac Apocalypse.  Thank you, Steve. We have a deal.”  With that, the face disappears, and Steve sits back in his chair, but only for a moment.  It’s time to get to work.</p>

<p>This week: how to deal with Mac Viruses</p>

<p>Q: I seem to have a virus on my Mac.  How do I get rid of it?</p>

<p>A: Mmmm-hmmm.  So, you got a virus, huh?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, I guess so.</p>

<p>A:  And where were you when you picked up this little “virus”?</p>

<p>Q: Uhhh, at home?</p>

<p>A: At home, but checkin’ out someone else’s homepage, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Q: Wha?</p>

<p>A: We all know <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=629">where Mac Viruses come from</a>, don’t we?</p>

<p>Q: What are you saying?</p>

<p>A: Oh, nothing, nothing.  What you do in your free time is your business, prevert.  Still, we have to help you if we’re going to prevent the Mac Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Q: The what?</p>

<p>A: Okay, here’s what you do to get rid of the virus:</p>

<p>Q: Don’t you want to know what virus it is?</p>

<p>A: First, you apologize to your Mac for taking it “off road”, so to speak…</p>

<p>Q: Apologize to my computer?</p>

<p>A: YES! Macs are very sensitive.  Second, you buy your Mac something nice, like a new mouse. Or maybe a USB hub. A new Time Machine drive is a thoughtful, sensitive gift.</p>

<p>Q: Well, I could use an external hard drive I guess…</p>

<p>A: It isn’t for you! It’s for your Mac.  Don’t be so selfish.  Third, you chant the incantation against the Mac Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Q: I don’t know the incantation against…</p>

<p>A: “Oh great Steve, protect us from the anti-Steve!”  Is that so hard?</p>

<p>Q: O-Okay…</p>

<p>A: and last, you just <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2007/10/firstlooks/trojanhorse/index.php">follow these steps</a>.  There! You’re virus free.  Now go and sin no more.</p>

<p>Q: Couldn’t I just…</p>

<p>A: The steps to cleanliness are non-negotiable! Screw this up and soon we’ll all need AV software crapping up our systems.  Do you want that on your head? Do you?</p>

<p>Q: No! I’ll do the steps! I’ll be clean!</p>

<p>A: Good.  Another Mac saved.  And in the nick of time, too. because the Mac Apocalypse is right around the corner<img src="#footnote_0_237" alt="1" title="Dun dun daaaaaaaaaaah!" /></p>

<p>He sits in a darkened room, the moon high above the cedars outside his home, somewhere in the great northwest.  Lines of green letters play across his face.  This is because he left the room to go get some more Cheetos, and his “The Matrix” screen saver had kicked in.  Moving the mouse he shudders slightly as his “Windows Vista” desktop comes back into view.  Okay, now, back to work.</p>

<p>“Developers, developers, developers,” he mutters under his breath as he seeks to write the virus that will finally bring those smug Mac users to their knees.  Sweating profusely, he returns to his Visual Basic code window.</p>

<p>This had started out so simple; and if Jeff Goldblum can write a virus on a Power Book that infects an alien mothership, why couldn’t our unnamed hacker write a perfect Mac virus on Windows? in Visual Basic?</p>

<p>“Come on, Steve! You can do this!” he says to himself, but his progress is still slow.   He’d developed his payload<a href="#footnote_0_232" title="a screen that says, “Macs are statistically insignificant!”">1</a> and his method of delivery<a href="#footnote_1_232" title="attaching the virus to an email with the subject, “Pass this on to all your friends for free money!">2</a> but for some reason, no matter how he re-formatted his code, whenever he tried to run it on the hated Mac Mini sitting on the corner of his desk it just…ignores his virus.  This is getting frustrating, and running a hand over his bald scalp he realizes that he’s just spread Cheetos dust all over his noggin again.  Sighing, he gets up and heads back to the shower.  His time will come, even if he has to pay a thousand corrupt bloggers to bring it about, even if he has buy all the botnets in North America to find the answer. The Mac Apocalypse is at hand, as sure as his name is Ste…</p>

<p>A crash of thunder shakes the windows as his “The Matrix” screensaver bathes the room in green light.</p>
