<p>The news that Steve Jobs is again taking medical leave has opened the door for anti-Apple pundits to try to sound sincere in their lack of vitriol towards the man who essentially started the personal computing revolution.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing better than false sincerity in a situation like this,” said Une Real, a made-up professor studying the effects of being terribly small-minded and vindictive on the average human psyche. “When a great person is having a less-than great time of things, it’s incredibly easy to sneak a few smug little digs at that person while  seemingly professing concern for their well-being. I believe the technical term for this is ‘being a total waste of flesh’.<a href="#footnote_0_1058" title="No, we’re not going to list real-life people we suspect would be in this camp. We’re above such things.">1</a> Unable to compete fairly, they find a puerile joy in kicking someone while they’re down.”</p>

<p>We here at CANS may occasionally make fun of Steve Jobs, but we hope it’s still obvious that we have a lot of respect for the man and the company he’s created. We would like to again publicly thank Steve for all he’s done to make our world a better place and wish him a speedy recovery.</p>

<p>Yeah, I realize it’s been almost an entire week since we’ve posted anything, but seriously, can you think of any Apple-type news that’s happened this week? It’s been pretty dang quiet is all I’m saying.</p>

<p>I mean, most weeks you can rely on Google to do something incendiary, or at least there’ll be some iPhone news, although calling anything short of new hardware “news” is kinda blowing things out of proportion. I mean, if the iPhone were to, say, get an all new antenna design so it could work with different carriers and solve the hideous “death grip” problem, that’d be something, but “oh look, there’s a new app!” just doesn’t cut it.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing that really gets our goat: If, say, Dave Barry were to write this article he would get thousands of letters explaining to him that there have been big Apple-centric news stories this week, and what was he thinking writing something like this. But my audience is all full of smart people who actually understand sarcasm and whatnot, so I don’t get the free follow-up article. I’ll tell you this, though: I’m not covering any more iPhone stories until they bring the blasted thing to T-Mobile. In the US, not in Germany, where T-Mobile’s had the iPhone forever. And even then, I’d probably still spend more time being annoyed by Google’s decision to contribute to browser fragmentation. Put all that to one side, and this article will be really unbalanced, because other than that, I’ve really got nothing this week.</p>

<p>Well, except for whatever tomorrow’s iFAQ will be about<a href="#footnote_0_1055" title="I know what it’s going to be about. It’s Just that you don’t. Well, you probably do, too. It’ll be about 800 words.">1</a></p>

<p>Okay then. As you were. Carry on.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we look at Apple’s favorite way to sell you more stuff: The Mac App Store!</p>

<p>Q: I see what they did there.</p>

<p>A: Not sure that counts as a question.</p>

<p>Q: No, see, everyone was all, “Maybe they’ll do what they did with iOS 4 and make it free because of the whole ‘look, now we can sell you stuff!’ angle, but now that the App Store isn’t part of Lion they can go back to charging for Lion.</p>

<p>A: How delightfully cynical. I’m sure it has nothing to do with making the Mac easier for people to use right here right now. And the whole “promoting the work of OSX developers” angle is completely bogus as well, right?</p>

<p>Q: Gotcha! You asked the first question. I win. Anyway, you’re fooling yourself. Apple likes OSX developers, but they like them even more now that they can make 30% of every sale. And they’ll like everyone better when they pay $40-$100 for Lion in a few months.</p>

<p>A: So, you’re one of the masses who are surprised that Apple, Inc. is a business and is actually into making some money once in a while.</p>

<p>Q: Hey, if  they want to make a few billion dollars here and there more power to ‘em say I. But I’m not part of the “Apple is doing it all for us” crowd either.</p>

<p>A: So, politics aside, did you have any questions about the actual App Store?</p>

<p>Q: What’s to ask? If you’ve used an iOS device you can figure it out. There’s some pretty animations hopping icons into your dock, and it’s nice that your software follows you around without you remembering to put all your serial numbers in to 1Password–</p>

<p>A: I love 1Password, by the way.</p>

<p>Q: Who doesn’t? It’s freakin’ awesome. But, again, not the point. The point is that Apple has, as they are wont to do, made the actual software dead simple. But behind the clean, simple interface lay a murky quagmire of politics and avarice.</p>

<p>A: In America<a href="#footnote_0_1053" title="and the rest of the English-speaking world. A is a bit Americo-centric in his speech patterns. But we like him anyway.">1</a> we call it “capitalism”. People trade money for things they perceive as valuable.</p>

<p>Q: So where’s the value in the App Store for the consumer? What is the developer getting for 30% of their profits?</p>

<p>A: The consumer gets auto-upgrades and no more concerns about their licenses, the developer gets to not worry about credit card processing or order management, as well as a built-in advertising channel.</p>

<p>Q: You’re kinda quashing the humor here.</p>

<p>A: Yeah, we sound like a financial program.</p>

<p>Q: Er…Steve Ballmer?</p>

<p>A: Phil Schiller?</p>

<p>Q: Nah, it doesn’t work. Humor really is all about context.</p>

<p>A: Oh well. We got an iFAQ written, even with all the portents of doom we were casting around yesterday.<a href="#footnote_1_1053" title="Well, today, really. Thanks to the miracles of WordPress">2</a></p>

<p>Q: I guess that counts for something.</p>

<p>We’re not really ready to post a full on iFAQ about the Mac App Store, because we haven’t upgraded to 10.6.6 yet. So we’re going to ask pointed questions in an effort to stir up pointless controversy. Mostly because it sounds like fun.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it true that the App Store will be giving a percentage of every purchase to the DEVIL?</li>
<li>What if I want to offer a free trial version of my app?

<ul>
<li>What do you mean that iOS developers already do that just fine?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the app store represent the end of the free market?</li>
<li>Will all my base belong to Apple?

<ul>
<li>Is it too early to hop on the retro “All your base” wagon?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happens if Apple discovers they secretly hate an App after they said they liked it? Will it disappear off my mac?</li>
<li>Is there anything in the app store, either by intent or by accident, that will make it easier for John Mayer to invade my computer?

<ul>
<li>Norah Jones is fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fun bonus question: Come up with the best name for Microsoft’s copycat App store that will probably be announced either at CES or later this year!

<ul>
<li>Our guess: Windows Live Program Marketplace 8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That’s all we have for today. Expect a really nice iFAQ tomorrow after we’ve had some time to play with the dang thing. Well, actually don’t. Whenever we promise a post bad things happen to it before we actually get it posted. So seek to manage your expectations accordingly. We’ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we take a minute to talk about the new year. That was funnier in our head.</p>

<p>Q: So, oh great prognosticating vowel, what can I expect from the next year?</p>

<p>A: Ah, you would have me pull back the curtains of time and show you the future would you? Few there be that survive such an encounter, and of those that do live to tell the tale, few there be that are grateful for the experience.</p>

<p>Q: Hmmm… yep, okay, I’m convinced. No need to end up dead or insane. Well, see ya!</p>

<p>A: Wait! Ummmmm, maybe you’ll be really lucky on both counts, in fact, yes, yes, I see now, your luck is great and you will be safe from insanity!</p>

<p>Q: Okay, I’ll play along. So, back to my original question. What does 2011 hold for us, the Apple Faithful?</p>

<p>A: The seeds of the future are planted in the past, and by examining the present growth of those seeds we may see their future, as we stated in the beginning of this sentence.</p>

<p>Q: So the future is…a lot of plants?</p>

<p>A: Man, I hope so. We seriously need some green stuff on this ol’ earth of ours. Just think, if every person planted a single tree–</p>

<p>Q: Hey, HEY! I came for mystic predictions, not hippie talk.</p>

<p>A: You say that like there’s a difference. Okay, the next year of Apple. Here goes.</p>

<h2>Predictions for 2011</h2>

<ul>
<li>The following version numbers will all happen:

<ul>
<li><strong>iPad 2</strong> : Smaller, bigger screen, extra pretentiousness</li>
<li><strong>iPhone 5</strong> : Now with working antennae!</li>
<li><strong>iWork 2011</strong> : Available only on the Mac App Store!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lion </strong>will be released amidst a flurry of both cat and battery puns.[4][4] The changes that were brought “Back to the Mac” from the iPad will irritate power users, who will complain about them on all manner of online forums, then secretly start using them, just as they have Expose, Time Machine, Spotlight, and all the other features that power users feel the need to decry until they try. Them. Until they try them. Sounds like an O.J. trial joke, doesn’t it? “Don’t decry until you try!” But I digress. The other next big thing will be</li>
<li><strong>The Mac App Store</strong>. Thousands of developers will rush to get their apps into the premier digital distribution channel for desktop applications. At the same time there will be thousands of developers complaining about the App Store’s “draconian” rules and the phrase “walled garden” will be bandied about even more than it already is.</li>
<li><strong>“This [<em>insert product name here</em>] is turned up to 11!” Jokes</strong> will persist throughout the new year, despite the fact that they stopped being funny in June of 2010. Or possibly right after “This is Spinal Tap” came out, depending on whom you ask.</li>
<li><strong>Android and Chrome OS</strong> will continue to market themselves as the clearly superior alternatives to iOS and OSX, respectively. Until Google decides to either kill Chrome OS or merge it with Android, at which point pundits who think that you can’t spell pundit without PUN[5][6] will try to decide if they should call it AndroChrome or ChromeDroid.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Jobs</strong> will get both more crotchety and more visionary, granting us all amazing new products that change the way we interact with our data, but also requiring that we also pay for the services of an Apple genius to ensure that we are interacting with that data in elegant and Apple-sanctioned ways.</li>
<li><strong>The Mac Pro</strong> will be cut from Apple’s product line as Apple pushes ever faster towards a completely consumer-level lineup of products and services. “Let’s face it, the only people who ever used Mac Pros the way they were meant to be used were Pixar employees…oh, wait” a suddenly thoughtful Steve Jobs will say on stage when he announces the move. In a completely unrelated note, Cars 3 will be made entirely in iMovie for iPhone.[6][7]</li>
<li><strong>Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and Linus Torvalds</strong> will face off in a three way battle to the death for the title of “Technology dictator for life”. Expect Torvalds to fall victim to Ellison’s brutal beard attack early in the action, only to reappear safe and sound in his home seconds later. When questioned about this he will simply say “Git: it’s a lot more powerful than you think.” and then write a blog post about his daughters. Back in the arena Jobs, resplendent in his Liquidmetal iArmor, will defeat Ellison easily, but spare his life to avoid the stain on his karma. Ellison will slink back to Oracle, a bitter and cynical old man. So no real change there.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>A: And that’s what you can expect from 2011!</p>

<p>Q: Wow. That’s amazing! You got all that from a busted Second Generation iPod Touch?</p>

<p>A: Don’t question my methods!</p>

<p>Q: Okay, sorry, sorry. Say, I’m heading over to a New Year’s Eve party. You wanna come?</p>

<p>A: Hey, sure.</p>

<p>Q: Man, this party’s going to be turned up to 11 baby!</p>

<p>A: *sigh* and so it begins.</p>

<p>2010 has been a big year for those of us who write things about Apple Products. It’s been a busy year for Apple, with a groundbreaking new product, a fiasco-riddled update to an existing product, and millions upon millions of new dollars flowing into their coffers. Join me as we look at some of the events of 2010 through the lens of hindsight and minimal research. As usual, we start with</p>

<p><strong>January</strong></p>

<p>Most of January was spent rampantly speculating about what Apple would be announcing at their Big Reveal event on the 27th. As it became more and more certain that some sort of Tablet was in the works the Mythical Apple Tablet became the focus of everyone’s imagination. Feature lists sprang up like Peashooters in Plants vs. Zombies<a href="#footnote_0_1031" title="which was also quite popular at the time">1</a> and everyone was, well, kinda disappointed when the device that was actually revealed turned out to be a very intelligently designed, sensible device at a surprisingly low price. However, once the iPad was announced we of the Apple press were left facing the question of what we should write about in</p>

<p><strong>February</strong></p>

<p>With the iPad announced but not released, we had a lot of time to try and figure out what, if anything, was coming next. Apple itself seemed to be entirely focused on getting the iPad right, and we didn’t even get any good rumors during the shortest and bleakest month. Nate went to California, and subsequently failed to write anything interesting about the trip, as his computer committed suicide every time he tried to work up a post. I’ll say this: it was very warm. Which sounds nice right now. December in SLC is bitter, bitter. But things warmed up in</p>

<p><strong>March</strong></p>

<p>With the announcement that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam </a>would be coming to the Mac. People wondered why it was that Apple let Valve beat them to the online software distribution punch. In other Apple news, the iPad still wasn’t released, and people continued the “big iPod Touch” jokes, and the “pad sounds like a feminine hygiene product” jokes, neither of which were funny.</p>

<p>In CANS news, “Q” spent March standing in line to buy an iPad, which was finally released in</p>

<p><strong>April</strong></p>

<p>The month of the iPad! It was finally here! It was real! Everyone wanted one! Little kids hugged them! It was like Christmas! The dang things were actually really good! There’s really nothing bad to say about the iPad launch. It went off well and the iPad was and is an amazing device. And it’s good that iPad news was so positive, because April is also the month of the iPhone 4 fiasco.</p>

<p>It’s old news, but still irritating. Gizmodo bought a prototype iPhone 4 from a guy who picked it up in a bar when someone left it there…you know the song. Anyway, this happened in April, and like any terrible news story, was still making waves in</p>

<p><strong>May</strong></p>

<p>We decided to spend May entirely inwardly focused, as “Q” was still weak from his exposure to the elements and we really hated all the negativity about the iPhone 4. We had our own run-in with negativity on our other blog when we thoughtlessly said some rude things about Roger Ebert. But out in Apple-world the iPhone 4 storm swirled on into</p>

<p><strong>June</strong></p>

<p>When the iPhone 4 was actually really announced to a not-very-surprised world. The Retina display is and</p>

<p>[![Apple Mac Mini 2010 Edition][4]][4]
Little. Aluminum. Different.</p>

<p>was an amazing idea, and this was before we knew the antennae on the device were flawed. The new Mac Mini was announced and Steve Jobs posted some thoughts about Flash. Adobe responded with typical aplomb, by which I mean various Adobe personnel told Apple where they could stick their magical devices. But, the Mac Mini, that was and is a thing of wonder. Or at least it’s really tiny and beautiful. But beauty isn’t everything, and in</p>

<p><strong>July</strong></p>

<p>We learned that form has to follow function as the iPhone 4 was officially launched and people discovered that wrapping their hands around the thing in certain ways reduced your signal strength. We here at CANS tried to ignore this whole mess then, and we continue to do so now. In July we heard from the future, the past, and an alternate reality, all to avoid “Antennagate” and it’s repercussions. Fortunately Apple announced a new battery charger at the end of July, so the month wasn’t a total loss. And speaking of loss, in</p>

<p><strong>August</strong></p>

<p>Apple lost their most interestingly named executive, Mr. Papermaster. We here at CANS felt the loss keenly, as we hadn’t made nearly enough jokes based on that name. I mean, look at it. Papermaster. Paper<em>master</em>. It’s just too good. But he’s gone and there’s nothing we can do about it. So we’re back to jokes about Phil Schiller. Ah well. Anyway, August segued right into</p>

<p><strong>September</strong></p>

<p>with the announcement of a big music event at which Apple announced all kinds of new iPods. the new iPod Touch should really be called the iPad Mini, and the new Nano should be called the iPod Shuffle Touch. An updated Apple TV was announced, and people still seem to feel that it’s got a long way to go before it reaches its full potential. And in</p>

<p><strong>October</strong></p>

<p><a href="#footnote_1_1031" title=" Look, you try coming up with 12 really good segues "><img src="#footnote_1_1031" title=" Look, you try coming up with 12 really good segues " alt="MacBook Air" /></a>We were told that the potential for a new version of OSX was about to become a reality. Well, actually, Lion isn’t due to ship until “Summer 2011″, but we got a sneak peek at what Apple’s working on. The “Back to the Mac” theme that they chose for the announcement event was, it turned out, more meaningful than we expected, as many UI decisions and idioms from the iPad are being brought back to the Mac, from which, Apple was quick to remind us, iOS originally came. Chief amongst these is a Mac App Store, which will let you buy your Mac Apps without going to real stores or the actual internet or anything. the App Store is set to launch in just a few days, well ahead of the rest of the Lion package. Seemingly designed specifically for Lion, Apple also released the new MacBook Air, which is so small it’s practically an iPad itself. Whether people will buy into it or not is anyone’s guess. Then it was</p>

<p><strong>November </strong><a href="#footnote_1_1031" title=" Look, you try coming up with 12 really good segues ">2</a></p>

<p>The month were I wrote a book, as I am wont to do. But even so, Apple wasn’t content to rest on their laurels. No, they finally put the axe to the XServe and buried the hatchet with Apple Corps. For the first time ever, it became possible to buy Beatles music on iTunes. Someday I might actually do so. But don’t hold your breath. And indeed, we were all breathing fairly easily heading into</p>

<p><strong>December</strong></p>

<p>Where Apple announced the early launch of the App Store, which won’t happen until next month. Many, many people got iPads as holiday presents, which of course means that it’s time to start speculating about the iPad 2′s specs and pricing.</p>

<p>And that’s 2010 in a nutshell. What will 2011 hold? Will the App Store for Mac take off like a rocket to the moon or fizzle out like that Ping thing that’s built into iTunes 10?

Will Penny and Leonard get back together, or are they going to pull a Ross and Rachael right up until the final episode of The Big Bang Theory?<a href="#footnote_2_1031" title="The parallels between Friends and TBBT are striking.

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Every year I try to come up with a clever post, that takes some classic poem and turns it into a bunch of stuff that has to do with all the Apple News we’ve seen over the previous year. And every year it turns into something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once upon a midnight dreary,<br/>
As I pondered weak and weary<br/>
Over many quaint and curious iPhone<br/>
Bought in days of yore</p></blockquote>

<p>and then before I get to the part where they’ll get upgraded “nevermore” I realize that I’m supposed to be trying to do a Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa/New Years/Saturnalia type poem, not a Halloween one. So then I try again with something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>The moon on the crest of the new-fallen snow<br/>
Glared like an iPad in in full sunlight below.<br/>
And Jobs in his kerchief, and Ive in his cap,<br/>
had just counted their money and an intern did slap<a href="#footnote_0_1020" title="Being me I would try to work a “fired. Out of a cannon” joke in here, but it really doesn’t scan at all.">1</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Which invariably gets pretty terrible.</p>

<p>I had good luck with the letters to Santa Jobs one year, which were fun to write and gave me a lot of latitude to make fun of all manner of people in concise and amusing ways. But doing that again would be basically admitting that I’m completely out of ideas.</p>

<p>So then I’ll try for the sentimental angle, thanking people for all their support over the past year, which really has been pretty great. Or I’ll drop hints about my upcoming “predictions for next year” post, which guarantees that said post will never get written. But I’ve decided I’m not going to do any of that this year.</p>

<p>Well, except for the “thank you” part. Seriously, thank you all for reading. You make this worth doing.</p>

<p>But other than that, I’m not doing any of the stuff I usually do. Instead, I’m trying something new this year. This year I’m going to write a short story. Like, just abandon the journalistic overtones and do some full-on fiction. It’ll be fun! And it doesn’t have to rhyme, which makes it better than poetry.</p>

<h2>The Macwood Caper</h2>

<p>Dirk Drake snubbed out his cigarette on the rain-slick bricks next to him and turned out of the alley, easing himself into the general flow of pedestrians practiced ease. There would be no way those goons could follow him now. He walked two blocks, then turned into a smoky, cheap bar on the corner. The other pedestrians were a little surprised, sure, but they lived in a detective-noir world. People spontaneously transformed into bars all the time here. Getting excited about something like that was a mug’s game. They kept walking, heads down in the rain.</p>

<p>Inside, Drake leaned on the bar and ignored the fact that if there was any continuity in this story from one paragraph to the next he’d be standing inside himself. He had some inner demons, sure, but he knew how to handle them.<br/>
“Next round’s on me, boys.” he said loudly, and everyone cheered, then came to the bar to place orders. In the din he was able to talk to the barkeeper quietly.<br/>
“Word on the street is, Mr. J ain’t to happy with you, Drake,” Pat the Barkeeper said. He really wished people would stop taking his name literally. His life was like an endless TSA screening process.</p>

<p>“I’m not here to make Mr. J happy. I got a job to do and I aim to do it.”</p>

<p>“What’d they offer you, that could make you switch sides like that?” Pat said.</p>

<p>“None of your business. Let’s just say they can make things easier on me. They got protection.”</p>

<p>“Come back, Dirk, and you won’t need protection. You know Mr. J can take care of you.”</p>

<p>Dirk didn’t say anything. He’d been offered quite a bit. Speed, Power, flexibility, and, of course, protection. He still wasn’t sure what he’d given up was worth it, though. He swallowed his drink in one gulp, made a face, then slapped a large wad of bills down on the counter.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep that in mind, Pat. Take care.”</p>

<p>Pat watched Dirk walk out of the bar, completely unconcerned that both the bar and everyone in it would cease to exist at the end of this paragraph. “If he hates the taste of Ginger Ale so much, why does he always order it?” Pat wondered aloud. But nobody answered. They all just stopped existing.</p>

<p>Dirk knew the way in. He slid silently down shadowed halls, drifted like a ghost through doors that should have set off more alarms than the announcement of an impending John Meyer concert–well, ghosts that weighed about 210 pounds and had a deep working knowledge of the type of security system used in this place– and at last was exactly where he wanted to be. Slowly he approached the dias in the middle of the room. Like most of the room itself, the dias was made of a single block of aluminum, elegantly carved and beautifully minimalist. And there, resting on a stand, which was resting on the dias, you see, I mean, not to detract from the action, but this should be made clear; on a stand on the dias was the object of his quest.</p>

<p>The Second Generation iPad Prototype.<a href="#footnote_1_1020" title="and you thought we’d never get around to the Apple-related stuff! Just wait until we work the holidays into this!">2</a></p>

<p>Dirk knew this was the most dangerous part of the mission. He knew this because he’s not stupid. The most dangerous part is always the part where you’re in the middle of the building of the company you’re trying to rob. Knowing this, he spent fully two minutes straining his senses to catch every sound, every flicker of light, every possible indication of a trap. But he’d made it. The alarms were turned off, completely unaware that he was there, and he was free. He reached out, and just as his hand was closing around the edge of the iPad a great, tolling startup chime rolled through the room. One seemingly solid aluminum wall lit up, bathing the room in light, and in the wall next to it a face appeared on a screen that Dirk knew wasn’t there a moment ago.</p>

<p>“Well well, Mr. Drake. I wish I could say I was surprised. We always knew you would return. What a pity that it has to be in such…confrontational circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t choose to leave, and I’m not too thrilled about being back.”</p>

<p>“But the money was too good, huh?”</p>

<p>“Let’s just say that I could win those seven flaming dares and still make less than they offered me to pull this heist.”</p>

<p>The man in the screen laughed. “Very clever. And now I’m to guess who is paying you, is that right? ‘Win those seven’ you said, which sounds suspiciously like “Windows 7″, so perhaps it’s Mr. B himself. “Flaming dares” or Daring Fireballs? and the heist? Well, we both know that was just a red herring. a John “Red” Herring. Well, I don’t think I’ll play, Mr. Drake.”</p>

<p>Dirk looked at the screen, hope and fear fighting in his heart.</p>

<p>“So what now? You got me. What’s your move?”</p>

<p>“My move, Mr. Drake? Just this. You’ve seen it. You know what we’re planning, at least on the surface. Unfortunately, that’s all you’re going to get. You’re free to get what you can for that information on the outside. Nothing you say is going to hurt us, indeed, any publicity is good publicity. You didn’t get what you were sent for, but you may be able to get something out of this after all. Merry Christmas, Mr. Drake.” <a href="#footnote_2_1020" title="Turns out that’s all the holiday cheer this story’s getting. Also, yes, we are well aware that Mr. J is Buddhist. But he’s also a retailer in America, and Christmas means something to anyone who sells things around here.">3</a></p>

<p>Two large, well-muscled and inexplicably aluminum-colored men walked to the center of the room and guided Dirk out of the building. Once they were off the property they turned around and left him, having never spoken a word. Drake walked off into the night. He wished it was more like Chicago, but this was suddenly Cupertino. It was fairly warm, even with the rain. He turned up his collar anyway, just for the look of the thing.</p>

<p>He had more information than a lot of people, and he might be able to get something out of it. But who to sell to? Giz? DF? Pogue? Mentally he checked down the list. Finally he decided on a buyer. He knew someone who would want the information, and was in a position to pay for it.</p>

<p>Far away, a phone rang.</p>

<p>“Dickson residence. Who’s calling?”</p>

<p>“Listen, Dickson. I’ve got a scoop. What’s it worth to ya?”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we look at the newest player in the OS game: Chrome OS.</p>

<p>Q: Why do we need a new OS? Especially one that’s basically just a browser?</p>

<p>A: Heck, why not? I mean, Chrome’s a pretty sweet browser, right?</p>

<p>Q: Sure, but–</p>

<p>A: And you like having things boot up quickly, right?</p>

<p>Q: Well, who doesn’t? But that’s not the point–</p>

<p>A: Well then I fail to see what your problem is. Is it that you hate Christmas, Mr. Grinch?</p>

<p>Q: Ah, the sweet smell of seasonal <em>ad hominem</em> attacks. How about this, hot shot: What do you do with your beloved Chrome OS when you’re not in range of a wireless or Verizon cell tower?</p>

<p>A: Well, that’s what books are for.</p>

<p>Q: So the best thing to do in case of network outage is to run straight back to the arms of Johannes Gutenberg, then?</p>

<p>A: Well, you could use a Kindle…</p>

<p>Q: And that’s kind of my point. I could buy a MacBook Air–</p>

<p>A: I can’t. How much do they pay you?</p>

<p>Q: And when I didn’t have a wireless connection my MacBook Air would still be useful. A Chrome OS laptop would be a very sleek, instant-on paperweight.</p>

<p>A: Seriously, First you’re standing in line for an iPad, now you’re saying you can buy MacBook Airs all willy-nilly. I’m doing this for my slim cut of our slim advertising revenue.</p>

<p>Q: People come for the star power baby. But you haven’t answered my question. Why should I limit myself when I can get all of the Chrome <em>OS</em> functionality on any other computer by just installing the free Chrome <em>browser</em>?</p>

<p>A: Maybe you should just go buy an answer to your question, Mr. Trump. It’s more than my job’s worth to answer questions like that, mate.</p>

<p>Q: So yeah, there’s no good reason to buy a Chrome OS laptop.</p>

<p>A: Especially since Google’s almost inevitably going to merge Chrome OS with Android at some point.</p>

<p>Q: Aha! there is an answer.</p>

<p>A: Look, Google’s good at a lot of things, but being really firm and steadfast in one thing ain’t one of them. They like to play far too much to make it a good bet to get in on the ground floor of anything that requires you to put money on the table. Stick to GMail, Chrome the Browser, and regular ol’ google searches, and remember what happened to all those people who tried to make business cases around Google Wave.</p>

<p>Q: “All those people”?</p>

<p>A: Well, Gina Trapani wrote a <a href="http://completewaveguide.com/">book</a> about it.</p>

<p>Q: Yeah.</p>

<p>A: So, one thumb down<a href="#footnote_0_1016" title="if the letter A has a thumb">1</a> for Google Chrome the OS, one thumb up for the browser. Happy now?</p>

<p>Q: Very. Well, I’m off to go spend more money than you make in a year. Later!</p>

<p>A: Rrrrgh. It’s a consonant’s world, I tell you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we help you help your eyes with the oddly-named <a href="http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/">F.lux</a> utility.</p>

<p>Q: Sometimes I stay up late, doing…things. Things that…hurt me.</p>

<p>A: What did the common Ellipsis ever do to you?</p>

<p>Q: I wake up, bleary-eyed and strained. I bump into walls in the dark. I feel like a backwards vampire.</p>

<p>A: You lost me</p>

<p>Q: I can’t see in the dark, you see.</p>

<p>A: Okay, sure. Whatever. I thought you meant you gave women blood transplants in the neck.</p>

<p>Q: Gross.</p>

<p>A: Right? But you’re the one that said it. Anyway, we’ve strayed pretty far afield. tell me, can you admit to me what these things are that you…do?</p>

<p>Q: Well, you see, I–</p>

<p>A: Remember to keep this family friendly.</p>

<p>Q: How do I say this? I edit spreadsheets.</p>

<p>A: Watch your mouth! We call them “Numbers Documents” around here.</p>

<p>Q: Okay, I edit Numbers Documents, but in Microsoft Products.</p>

<p>A: I thought I told you to watch your mouth!</p>

<p>Q: The problem is that all that white space starts to make my eyes hurt around 11:30 at night, and by 1:00 am I’m walking into walls and all wired and stuff.</p>

<p>A: My friend, I can help.</p>

<p>Q: Can you? Can you really?</p>

<p>A: It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick, but–Well, actually, it’ll be both. But yes, if you’re willing, I can offer you assistance.</p>

<p>Q: But will it be expensive? Because I’m still saving up to buy that nice new serif for little q that she wanted for Quistmas.</p>

<p>A: One more pun like that and so help me…</p>

<p>ENTIRE CAST OF MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL: <strong>GET ON WITH IT!</strong></p>

<p>A: The answer to your problem is F.lux, a program that modifies the brightness of your monitor to match the current light at the time of day. So your screen dims at night, leaving you more ready to sleep and less prone to bump into walls. Just tell it where you live and it’ll do the rest. You’ll never have to think about it again.</p>

<p>Q: But what if I’m doing something that would be terrible if I played with my brightness settings?</p>

<p>A: Then you can tell it to change things back for an hour or so. But for the most part it quietly, subtly changes your brightness to stop destroying your night vision and ability to sleep.</p>

<p>Q: Why the oddly placed dot in the name, though?</p>

<p>A: Some mysteries were meant to stay unsolved, my friend. Savor the mystery. And your less-obliterated night vision.</p>

<p>Q: This I will do. Thank you. You have been most helpful. No, don’t get up, I’ll see myself out. [<em>runs into wall next to door, then finds door. Falls down stairs.</em>]</p>

<p>A: Sure you will.</p>
