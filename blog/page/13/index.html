<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we continue our look at all things textish with a blast from the past: <a href="http://www.typestyler.com/">Typestyler X</a>, the revived version of Typestyler!</p>

<p>Q: Hey, wow! Typestyler is back! I loved that program on my ol’ Flower Power iMac!</p>

<p>A: Yep! It’s back and better than ever!  Typestyler X makes full use of OpenGL, Quartz, CoreImage–</p>

<p>Q: And a website that was apparently designed in 1991!</p>

<p>A: What?</p>

<p>Q: Do <em>you</em> even click on your links?  Their website looks like it was designed on Dreamweaver 1.0 using MacPaint.  I mean look at this button:</p>

<p>[![Ultra-Classy Button][3]][3]
Ultra-Classy Button</p>

<p>A: Well, yeah, it’s not the best ever, but you can’t judge the program on the website…</p>

<p>Q: Wait, why not? They’re selling software that’s designed to make beautiful buttons, logos, etc. and this is what they have on their own site? I mean, here’s a better button I created in 40 seconds in ArtText2:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.belightsoft.com/products/arttext/overview.php"><img src="http://www.belightsoft.com/products/arttext/overview.php" alt="Extra Super special button" /></a>
Extra Super special button</p>

<p>A: Well, they’ve been so busy getting the new version out, and things have been difficult, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Q: They’ve had <em>seven years</em>! Seven. Years.  And they hadn’t thought to update the graphics on their site in that entire time?  And somehow based on the strength of this website, <em>sans</em> screenshots, <em>sans</em> example files, they expect me to drop $200 for something that <a href="http://www.belightsoft.com/products/arttext/overview.php">ArtText</a> does for less than $40?</p>

<p>A: Well, Typestyler has a long tradition of being…wait, $200?</p>

<p>Q: Do you have an existing license?</p>

<p>A: No…</p>

<p>Q: Then you get to pay $200.  Do not pass go, do not collect squat.</p>

<p>A: Ouch. But wait! I’m sure the program rocks!</p>

<p>Q: Honestly, if you didn’t love it as an OS 9 program you won’t be impressed. It still looks a lot like OS 9.  Old. School. I mean, it’s powerful, and it’s got good features, but it’s ugly and hard to use.</p>

<p>A: Man, that’s harsh.  Which is usually my role.</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, you kinda didn’t answer any questions this week.</p>

<p>A: Well, I learned about ArtText, and that’s something.</p>

<p>Q: Good for you! That’ll be $200.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we bring you the master of typography: <a href="http://pagehand.com/">Pagehand</a>.<a href="#footnote_0_567" title="Once again, I’m writing an iFAQ for software that I genuinely like, and hope to someday purchase.  These aren’t usually my funniest. You have been warned.">1</a></p>

<p>Q: I hate Word!</p>

<p>A: Word.</p>

<p>Q: Right.</p>

<p>A: What?</p>

<p>Q: I said I hate Word, you said “Word”, and I assumed that you were just agreeing with me.</p>

<p>A: Ah, right.</p>

<p>Q: So, do you have an answer?</p>

<p>A: Did you ask a question?</p>

<p>Q: Would you like me to ask a question?</p>

<p>A: Do you want to explain why you hate Word?</p>

<p>Q: …Yeah. Okay, I hate Word because it does stupid things to innocent text.  I mean, why should I have to dig for six miles in piles to change styles?</p>

<p>A: So you can re-style your file?</p>

<p>Q: Yes, you imbecile!</p>

<p>A: Now you’re getting puerile.</p>

<p>Q: And you’re using a dictionary.  Stop it.  So, to sum up: I hate Word because it makes things I write ugly and makes it hard to make things pretty.  Do you have a solution to my problem? An answer to my question? A Bonnie to my Clyde?</p>

<p>A: That last one didn’t really fit.</p>

<p>Q: Noted.  Are you going to answer me?</p>

<p>A: Pagehand.</p>

<p>Q:What?</p>

<p>A: You want your document to look perfect, you want text that flows cleanly across the page, and you want to be able to style your document without a climbing harness and a pick axe, right?</p>

<p>Q: Right.</p>

<p>A: Pagehand. Pagehand is your solution!  It’s simple, clean, has contextual menus that make sense and only appear when needed, and  it’s almost insanely focused on how your document will look.  It’s native file format is PDF, so you know that your documents will look the same no matter where you send them, PC, Mac, or Linux.</p>

<p>Q: Great! Now I can finally re-style that text box on the third page of my great new novel-slash-programming manual!</p>

<p>A: Whoa, hold up there, hoss.  Pagehand don’t do no textboxes. Yet, anyway.</p>

<p>Q: Wait, what? Why?</p>

<p>A: Where? Who? When?</p>

<p>Q: Kindly explain.</p>

<p>A: Pagehand is new, and made by one guy who believes that we should make pretty documents, but he’s still one guy and needs a bit of time and support before he can get his product to be all that you can be.</p>

<p>Q: So he wants me to pay for beta software?</p>

<p>A: No, he wants you to pay for 1.0 software, and he wants you to pay 20% less for 1.0 software than you would for 1.1 software.  It’s a fair deal. I mean, look what Microsoft wants you to pay for.</p>

<p>Q: Fair enough.</p>

<p>A: Be sure to read the section of the help file called “Producing Beautiful Documents”. It will change your life.</p>

<p>Q: Ummm…</p>

<p>A: Once you read about the true way of document design you will not want to stray from it again.  Indeed, in purity, and only in purity of design is there safety from the evils of Times New Roman.  Live it, love it, be it; the good design for the ages.  Amen.</p>

<p>Q: Okay! Well, thank you for your time. I gotta go now. Bye!</p>

<p>A: Return you will, when more training you need, yes. MmmMMMmmmm.</p>

<p>Frustrated by years of being unable to bring their animation-cum-game-creation technology to the iPhone platform, Adobe has announced plans to make Flash 5 <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcs5/appsfor_iphone/#faq">capable of building iPhone apps</a>.</p>

<p>“We expect that this will spell the end of native iPhone apps as we know them,” chortled Adobe’s CRAP<a href="#footnote_0_561" title="Chief Ruiner of Apple’s Products">1</a> Dearth Maul. “Once Flash CS 5 comes out, people can start ignoring the “hard” Objective-C language and write their apps in our much more newbie developer friendly ActionScript!”</p>

<p>“OpenGL ES! Accelerometer support! Google maps! Native controls,” ranted Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, trying to convince people to use Apple’s tools for iPhone development, apparently by reciting random lists at them. “I mean, can Flash do 3D? No. Games based on tilting the device? No.  All Flash can do is 2D stuff, simple, brightly colored…Awww, crap. Who am I kidding? <a href="http://freeverse.com">Freeverse</a> will continue to make good games for the iPhone, everyone else will start making their crappy games in Flash, instead of just making  crappy games that <em>look</em> like they were made in Flash.  Crap.”</p>

<p>Peter Oppenheimer was quick to point out that Apple will still “get $99 up front and 30% in perpetuity” from Flash iPhone developers, just as they do from Objective-C iPhone developers.  These words did little to comfort the perfectionist Forstall.</p>

<p>“Still gonna look like crap,” Forstall muttered.</p>

<p>Normally this is where we would say that Apple was unavailable for comment, but with a long comment from Forstall we are left without a good ending to this article. Crap.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that, in my haste to publish the earnings of this blog, I failed to mention one line item. It is with the intent to rectify this oversight that I do hereby publish the following:</p>

<li><strong>Over 200 comments apiece from two very faithful commenters, valued at</strong>: giving me a reason to keep doing this.

<p>In order to be fully compliant with <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/143135/2009/10/bloggers_ftc.html?lsrc=rss_main">this new guideline</a>, the CANS staff does hereby make the following disclosure:</p>

<p>In the 1.5 years we have been covering Apple news and events, we have received the following material considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>From Apple, Inc, their subsidiary and affiliate companies:</strong> Nothing, valued at $0.</li>
<li><strong>From Microsoft, and former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates:</strong> Nothing, valued at $0.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Waves of shock rocked the Microsoft campus today. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has ceased to exist following an announcement that his entire existence in the first place was the result of a “rounding error” by accountants using Microsoft Money.</p>

<p>This news is made ironic<a href="#footnote_0_557" title="or made up">1</a> in light of a recent interview the nonexistent CEO gave recently stating that Apple’s Safari browser and Google’s Chrome were both “<a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/09/30/steve_ballmer_safari_a_rounding_error_mac_losing_market_share.html">Rounding Errors</a>“, as opposed to Mozilla Firefox, which is statistically relevant.</p>

<p>“It was actually his comments that led us to look deeper at Microsoft’s finances,” admitted P. Waterhouse of Pfister Attorneys and Pflumbers<a href="#footnote_1_557" title="“The Pfancy Pfrosecutors with the Pfunny name”">2</a>. “We had been hired to do a routine audit of Microsoft’s accounts and holdings, and in the course of our investigation we came to find that the existence of a being such as “Steve Ballmer” was so statistically improbable that we were forced to conclude that he does not, in fact, exist.”</p>

<p>When asked what effect this could have on the company, Waterhouse replied, “well, obviously they’re going to need a CEO with enough essential existence to maintain a physical presence. We have recommended that Paul Allen pull a Steve Jobs, but for some reason he’s locked himself in his office and is adamantly refusing to talk to us about what he calls ‘a sinking ship’. We tried to explain to him that a software company, unlike a boat, actually can be unsinkable, but he refuses to listen.”</p>

<p>Rumors that Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, and/or Phil Schiller have been approached to take over Mr. Ballmer’s spot have been neither confirmed nor denied by our contacts at Apple. Not surprisingly, Mr. Ballmer was also unavailable for comment.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we follow the old advice to write about what you know.  By writing about the only program we’ve used this entire week: NetBeans.</p>

<p>Q: Can NetBeans write C code?</p>

<p>A: No Talky! Head hurty! Thinking…thinking no happen.  Ask ‘droids.  They know stuff.</p>

<p>Q: O-Okay. Um, droids?</p>

<p>A: <code>Yes?</code></p>

<p>Q: Can I write C using NetBeans?</p>

<p>A: <code>We only use TextMate. And Ruby. So we wouldn't know.</code></p>

<p>Q: So why did he tell me to ask you?</p>

<p>A: <code>to get rid of you, most likely.</code></p>

<p>Q: That was painfully honest. Should I bug him again?</p>

<p>A: <code>We would. It's funny.</code></p>

<p>Q: Okay then! Hey! Answer guy?</p>

<p>A: MmmmmMMMmmmMGGGH! NO! I won’t find any more paths between nodes in an n-vertex graph! You can’t make me!</p>

<p>Q: I don’t want to make you.</p>

<p>A: YOU optimize the matrix to run with over one hundred thousand nodes! I’m a web programmer, not a philosopher!</p>

<p>Q: So why do you use NetBeans?</p>

<p>A: It works with Subversion. And subverts my thoughts and dreams and makes me see code when my eyes are closed. But it’s better than Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Q: Wow, hey, really?</p>

<p>A: No, not really. But it runs on a Mac and can handle open source languages.</p>

<p>Q: Like Objective-C?</p>

<p>A: Wha? Why? That’s what XCode is for. NetBeans is for annoying student projects.</p>

<p>Q: What about Eclipse? I keep hearing good things about Eclipse.</p>

<p>A: Eclipse <em>is</em> an annoying student project. That IBM decided to pay for. Don’t listen to everything you read on the web. AND don’t correct my grammar. Too tired.</p>

<p>Q: Well, I guess you answered my question–</p>

<p>A: Not likely, mate.</p>

<p>Q: — So I’ll let you get back to your delusions.</p>

<p>A: Wait, you’re not a delusional illusion? Gaaaah more ibuprofin! More gatorade! Must write cold in spite of the head code! Can’t stop the rock!</p>

<p>Q: Okay! have fun with that! Bye now.</p>

<p>A: Also, if you’re getting ready for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>,<a href="#footnote_0_555" title="And you thought that I’d forget!">1</a> Don’t use <a href="http://www.the-soulmen.com/ulysses/">Ulysses</a>. Ulysses’ interface makes rats barf. <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a> is better. And Cheaper. And Better. Did I say that already?</p>

<p>Q: Yes.</p>

<p>A: Good. Because it is. Choosy mac users choose Scrivener. And WriteRoom. Use ‘em together! on your ‘Pod! ‘Sgreat. Now go ‘way. Gotta do the assignment! Gotta get extra credit. Needa extra credit card. Heheheh *THUMP*</p>

<p>Really!</p>

<p>For years<a href="#footnote_0_549" title="1 and a bit">1</a>, you have had to read CANS on your gigantic laptop or desktop computer. Trying to read this glorious repository of Apple-flavored wit and wisdom on an iPhone or iPod Touch was a frustrating, nay, infuriating experience.</p>

<p>But no more!  Through countless hours<a href="#footnote_1_549" title="okay, three">2</a> of diligent effort, the Androids and I have brought forth: <a href="http://crazyapplenews.com/m">Mobile CANS</a>.</p>

<p>That’s right, all you owners of pocket-sized computers! From now on you can access the latest and greatest in made up news in full HTML5-style glory at .  It even looks pretty good as a <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/whatarewebapps.html">web clip!</a></p>

<p>The Mobile site has all the the flavor and all the footnotes of the full-size site, with none of the archives! That’s right, Mobile CANS lets you live your life by only showing you the last ten posts to the site.  But don’t worry: it considerately stores those articles on your device so even when you’re off line you are on top of the world of new gadgets…and the geeks who love them.</p>

<p>How much would you pay for all this conveneince? Nothing, obviously! I mean come on, you’ve already clicked the link and you’re using the new site instead of the old one, aren’t you?  Well that’s right friends, all this power, all this lack-of-archive, all this style can be yours absolutely free! Act now! Supplies are limited<a href="#footnote_2_549" title="theoretically">3</a>! Operators are standing around.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we take a look at the new and improved Mail.app as portrayed by Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>Q: I have a lot of email accounts already! What’s a guy gotta do to keep them all organized? I’m lost in a forest of emails, and I need some direction!</p>

<p>A: Have you tried Hare Krishna?<a href="#footnote_0_547" title="This joke appears courtesy of Dr. Teeth and the 70′s.">1</a></p>

<p>Q: Enough with the witty banter already! I swimming in emails! Also, the terminology! POP, IMAP, Exchange, who can keep it all straight I ask you?</p>

<p>A: So you want to be able to handle all your emails in one place?</p>

<p>Q: And the spam! Always with the free offers of medicines, or loans, or the ceaseless pleas for help from princes of distant countries!</p>

<p>A: You didn’t actually fall for any of those, did you?</p>

<p>Q: I answered one or two why not? But all I got was emails with pictures of kittens attached.</p>

<p>A: Yeah, those were “trojan horse” virus emails.</p>

<p>Q: What’s with the talking and the not making any sense? They were kittens I tell you. Kittens!</p>

<p>A: Y-yeah. Anyway, you’re using a Mac, right?</p>

<p>Q: My son set it up for me. He bought me an iMac. I said it was too expensive, that he should keep the nice computer and his mother and I would just use the telephone, but he insisted! he’s a doctor you know. Also, my work uses the Exchange server for their emails, and the Entourage, oh its horrible! Horrible!</p>

<p>A: You’re telling me. Well, fortunately, I have a solution for you. Mail.app can handle all your email accounts in one place, even the work one.</p>

<p>Q: Oh, how I wish I could believe you! How nice it would be to not have to log in to dozens of different sites to read the letters my friends send me from Palm Beach.</p>

<p>A: Your problems are at an end. Mail makes it easy to add all your accounts to one program, and it checks them all for you. Also you can have it sort your mail, so letters from your friends show up in a nice friendly green, while messages from that guy who took your lawnmower in ’68 get sent straight to the trash.</p>

<p>Q: Alright, alright, I’m interested. What’s this going to cost me, all this new technology?</p>

<p>A: Well, no matter what Mac you have, most of it is already there. If you want to be able to sign into your work email, that’s going to cost $30 if you don’t already have Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>Q: Oh, the Snow Leopard! My son, he put that on my iMac last week. He said it would make things faster. I told him that if somebody put a snow leopard in me I would be faster too. But kids these days, what are ya gonna do?</p>

<p>A: Well, then, you’re all set. Now you can set up all your email accounts and thank your son for the help. Send him a nice email.</p>

<p>Q: What’s the use? He never writes back! I mean, would it kill him to write once in a while, Mr. Big Shot Doctor?</p>

<p>A: What kind of doctor is he?</p>

<p>Q: He’s a Mac Doctor!</p>

<p>A: Yeah, I should have expected that.</p>

I write stories about <em>other people</em> who write stories about new financial practices. Which is clearly better.</p>
