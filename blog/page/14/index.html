<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: Mariner Software’s most non-baseball-related program: MacGourmet.</p>

<p>Q: I really want to learn to cook Julia Child.</p>

<p>A: You mean cook <em>like</em> Julia Child.</p>

<p>Q: No, no. I said it right.</p>

<p>A: Next!</p>

<hr />

<p>Q: I have many hundreds of recipes. But I also have the worst memory.</p>

<p>A: What makes you say that?</p>

<p>Q: What makes me say what? No, only kidding. Seriously. I’ll make some awesome soup–</p>

<p>A: Mmmmmmm…. Sooooup…. Gaaaaaahhhhhh….</p>

<p>Q: Focus!</p>

<p>A: Hmm, yes, sorry. So, you make some awesome, delicious, wholesome, soul-warming, thick and tasty potato soup with bacon and chives…</p>

<p>Q: Hey! No, I usually make vegetable soup or minestrone. And it’ll turn out well, but two weeks later I don’t remember what I did and I have to make up the recipe from scratch.</p>

<p>A: Well, I have the answer to all your problems, friend! Try MacGourmet! Not only does it store, categorize, and allow you to publish your recipes to the web<a href="#footnote_0_541" title="with MobileMe account, sold separately">1</a>, but it also calculates nutritional data for all your chowders, consommés, mulligatawnies, minestrone, noodle soups, rice soups, stews, broths, cream soups…</p>

<p>Q: And casseroles!</p>

<p>A: Wha? Huh? Oh, yeah, sure, if you can call a casserole <em>cooking</em>.</p>

<p>Q: I can and do, my friend.</p>

<p>A: You know what casserole is? It’s soup gone wrong. It’s <em>lazy</em> soup. It’s soup without the love. Casserole, bah!</p>

<p>Q: Will MacGourmet help me categorize my casseroles?</p>

<p>A: Sure! Sure! Why not? Do whatever you like! I suppose you can store your favorite recipe for rat poison in there too, but that doesn’t make it <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>Q: What about roasts? Are you okay with roasts?</p>

<p>A: With gravy?</p>

<p>Q: Yes.</p>

<p>A: Carry on.</p>

<p>Q: So, can I use MacGourmet to keep track of my different recipes for roasts, and sort them by the person from whom I learned the recipe?</p>

<p>A: Yes. It’s good at things like that. And it will help you plan out your meals for the week and generate a shopping list so you can buy everything you need in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Q: Hey, that’s great!</p>

<p>A: Yeah! so, let’s say you were going to make <a href="http://www.nibbledish.com/people/iconsam/recipes/arroz-caldo--filipino-congee">Arroz Caldo</a>. It would tell you how much ginger you needed, how much rice, how much chicken, how much broth… How long to cook the rice to get it niiice and tender, but not mushy, how to delicately season the chicken…</p>

<p>Q: Yep!</p>

<p>A: How to serve the dish on a rainy day, so that it warms the soul of the person eating it…</p>

<p>Q: That’s just what I’ll do!</p>

<p>A: *sigh* <em>Namimiss ko naman. Babalik sana ako.</em><a href="#footnote_1_541" title="Ano? Hindi ka mauronong managalog? ">2</a><a href="#footnote_2_541" title="What? you don’t speak Tagalog?">3</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Market researchers with too much time on their hands have made an astounding discovery.<br/>
“We have conducted polls of over 2000 people and found that all but one of them agreed that ‘paying less is better than paying more’.</p>

<p>“And that one apparently thought we said ‘We should pay Pauly Shore’ a point of view that is naturally untenable.”</p>

<p>However, the data from this poll seemed doomed to be unproven, until Apple released Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>“Suddenly we had a real product on which to test our theory,” said the same lab-coat-wearing geeky-looking guy. We never did get his name. “Snow Leopard cost less than Leopard AND gives no money to Pauly Shore! It’s the perfect product! So you can imagine our surprise when Snow Leopard sales have been significantly stronger than Leopard sales.</p>

<p>“We’re talking pants-wetting levels of surprise, folks.”</p>

<p>Steve Ballmer has reportedly been mock-stomping copies of Snlow Leopard in Microsoft all-staff meetings, but this has not had any noticable affect on sales.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with all major announcements concerning new iPods, tablets, and iPhones either in the past or far in the future, Apple rumor sites have already started speculating on sales figures for OSX 10.7 “Gruber”.</p>

<p>Current estimates on AppleInsider say that 10.7 will sell 40 million copies in the first day. Apple was unwilling to comment, but pointed upward, raised their eyebrows, and nodded significantly.</p>

<p>Every Friday<a href="#footnote_0_535" title="More or Less">1</a> we publish a list of inFrequently <em>Answered </em><a href="#footnote_1_535" title="Thanks to Ace for the new, much more Apple-y, much more appropriate name">2</a> Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>Today we try to tone things down a bit and actually answer a few questions about iTunes 9: the little jukebox that could.</p>

<p>Q: So, I still have a question about Rock Mix 2: The Revenge of Backbeats in my Genius Mix list. It still plays “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJv5qLsLYoo">You Spin Me Round</a>”<a href="#footnote_2_535" title=" The video is worth it just for the guy’s hair">3</a> by Dead or Alive like, five times an hour.</p>

<p>A: Are you accidentally listening to Sirius Satellite Radio Channel 8?</p>

<p>Q: How could you possibly make a mistake like that?</p>

<p>A: Ask my boss. But no, I see your problem is deeper than that. You have come to Apple seeking improvements, and instead you received bass-heavy dance songs that do not fit the un-european flair you were going for in your playlist.</p>

<p>Q: Florid, perhaps, but that about sums it up.</p>

<p>A: And then, when seeking comfort, guidance and solace from your favorite source of made-up news, you were not given an answer, but were instead subjected to several hundred words of gloating, the effect of which was not as the balm of Gilead to your wounded soul.</p>

<p>Q: I wasn’t going to say anything, but that is also true.</p>

<p>A: Fear not, brave traveler! For while we have been discussing your plight, my crack team of Ruby Ninja Androids have been analyzing your iTunes library, and it seems to me that they have found a solution!</p>

<p>Q: What! How? I’ve got, like, passwords and stuff!</p>

<p>A: They have their ways, and it’s best not to know about them. But fear not, for they shall only use their knowledge of your extensive collection of bootleg Dylan tracks for good.</p>

<p>Q: I’m still creeped out by the whole thing.</p>

<p>A: That is to be expected. But soft! An answer awaits!</p>

<p>Q: Really, on this site?</p>

<p>A: Indeed! There is a simple way to get rid of the faux-disco plague!</p>

<p>Q: Tell me!</p>

<p>A: Yes, an answer that even a simple mind such as yours could comprehend!</p>

<p>Q: And? What is it?</p>

<p>A: Simply remove the cursed song from your library and replace it with “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAdaQhitdKg">Don’t You Forget About Me</a>” as made popular in the Molly Ringwald hit movie “The Breakfast Club”! This track will take the place of the other, coarser song and you will be transported back to a simpler time, a time when breakfast was indeed enjoyed in clubs, or occasionally in the mall after walking fourteen laps around the place.<a href="#footnote_3_535" title="I used to work in a mall. Lots of people did laps in there, then got breakfast at Cinnabon.">4</a></p>

<p>Q: Ummm…Okay, I guess that works.</p>

<p>A: Indeed! And it’s so much easier than changing your listening habits drastically enough to convince the Genius that you don’t love listening to Dead or Alive ponder their similarity to a record.</p>

<p>Q: Would that work?</p>

<p>A: Indeed. Listen to enough Vivaldi, Handel, Chopin, Mozart, and Toad the Wet Sprocket and you will find the crazy hair bands of the 80′s are replaced by the crazy hair guys of the Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods, and the actually-quite-normal-hair guys of the nineties.</p>

<p>Q: Actually, now that I think about it, I kinda like that song. Lot’s of synthesizer, super pretentious…</p>

<p>A: That works too.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: Everyone’s favorite media player’s newest incarnation: iTunes 9!</p>

<p>Q: I have a question about “Genius Mixes”; Why does my “Rock Mix 2″ play some tracks over and over?</p>

<p>A: That’s a good question. But you know what a better question would be?</p>

<p>Q: Ummm…</p>

<p>A: Something more like, “hey, where did you get that absolutely <em>beautiful</em> MacBook Pro?”</p>

<p>Q: So, did you get a MacBook Pro?</p>

<p>A: Or an even better question would be, “Hey, did you win some sort of major award at your place of employment, and then use part of the proceeds of that major award to purchase an absolutely <em>stunning</em> 15″ MacBook Pro?”</p>

<p>Q: I’m not even going to try to remember all that. Look, are you going to answer my question or what?</p>

<p>A: I don’t know what your problem is. iTunes works fine on my brand new MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Q: Really?</p>

<p>A: Yes!… Maybe. I don’t actually have any music on there yet. But I plan to use home sharing later to pull a bunch of my music off of my iMac onto my new–</p>

<p>Q: –MacBook Pro. Yes, got it. So really, you don’t know what’s going on at all, as far as iTunes 9 is concerned, huh?</p>

<p>A: Well, I installed it on my iMac and my old MacBook, but I haven’t really had all that much time to play with it. I was too busy being named one of the six best employees IN THE WORLD!!!</p>

<p>Q: Really?</p>

<p>A: Maybe, or maybe it was more “one of the six recipients of an award given out by a fairly large UNIVERSITY that’s in the state OF UTAH“.</p>

<p>Q: You’re a bit useless this week,you know that?</p>

<p>A: Do you know how many days I’ve worked this week? 1.5<img src="#footnote_0_532" title="State holiday, work adjust day for working 16 hours in one day last week, one day home sick, one day allowed to go home early because I’d just become the first employee of my department to win my employer’s most prestigious award" alt="1" /></p>

<p>Q: You are a paragon of employeeship. Okay, maybe you’ll be in the mood to actually answer questions next week. Have fun with your new toy.</p>

<p>A: Wait, what? I was too busy turning the lights off and watching my keyboard light up.</p>

<p>Q: My point exactly.</p>

<p>This week: <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>, the image editor that isn’t as expensive as Photoshop, but also isn’t as ugly as <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the Gimp</a>!</p>

<p>Q: Why you gotta say the Gimp is ugly?</p>

<p>A: Ummmm, because it is? I mean, X11? Seriously?</p>

<p>Q: But it has so much power! It’s elegance is matched only by its–</p>

<p>A: Really crappy interface! And anyway, we’re here to talk about Pixelmator.</p>

<p>Q: Never used it.</p>

<p>A: What? That what possible questions could you have about it?</p>

<p>Q: None. Some shiny robot guy told me to come in here and ask questions or else he’d elegantly reformat my hard drive.</p>

<p>A: Well that’s just great! How am I supposed to write an iFAQ with a “Q:” Guy who doesn’t have any questions?</p>

<p>Q: You could ask me questions!</p>

<p>A: About a program you’ve never used?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah! Wait, no. Hmmm… I see your point.</p>

<p>A: Listen, just…just read these cards okay?</p>

<p>Q: This seems weird. I feel dishonest doing this.</p>

<p>A: Give ya a buck!</p>

<p>Q: Okay! Here goes. Ahem. “How will pixelmator make me mroe popular with the ladies?”</p>

<p>A: What? That’s not what I wrote! I would never misspell the word “more”!</p>

<p>Q: Well, yeah, but your question was boring! Anyway, if it can make me more popular with the ladies, then I might be interested.</p>

<p>A: Okay, whatever. Look, if you can make a real nice picture, with like, hearts and flowers and print it with the lady’s name in the middle and stuff, then maybe that’ll help a little bit.</p>

<p>Q: What if I don’t know her name? What if I always just call her sweet–</p>

<p>A: Then you have bigger problems. Now, can we please just ask image manipulation questions?</p>

<p>Q: Okay, fine. How can I make an image do my bidding?</p>

<p>A: What?</p>

<p>Q: Why else would I manipulate it? Other than to torture its psyche, that is.</p>

<p>A: Yeah, okay, we’re done here.</p>

<p>Q: Don’t pretend you haven’t thought about it. And anyway, why haven’t you answered my question!</p>

<p>A: Well, you can warp, twist and blur your image. Does that help?</p>

<p>Q: A little.</p>

<p>A: Fine. Bye now.</p>

<p>This week: Snow Leopard, the coolest cat since the Fonz.</p>

<p>In honor of the <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1095">fitfully departed CARS</a>, we will be using this space to take calls and answer people’s questions about their new OS.</p>

<p>Q: Hi, I just bought the snow leopard upgrade, but the process seems to be taking a long time.</p>

<p>A: Really? What kind of computer are you trying to install it on?</p>

<p>Q: Computer? What? No, I just took my leopard up north.  He looks cold, sure, but I don’t see his ears shrinking to conserve warmth, and his tail hasn’t become massive and muscular to help him maintain balance on the rocky terrain.  He’s still as clumsy as…. Well there he goes. Right over the edge.</p>

<p>A: Ummmm, your system was faulty to begin with.</p>

<p>Q: I’ll say.</p>

<hr />

<p>A: Hi, I’m having trouble upgrading to Snow Leopard…</p>

<p>Q: Wait, before you start, you did purchase the Apple Snow Leopard DVD, and you are attempting to install it on a currently running Leopard system, correct?</p>

<p>A: Yeah, I bought the disc, went home and tried to install it on my leopard.</p>

<p>Q: You mean, your Mac running leopard, right?</p>

<p>A: Well, my leopard was always a Linux guy, actually. anyway, I put the disc in and, boy, he’s running now! But he doesn’t seem any more fit for life on the tundra.</p>

<p>Q: You…put the disc… in…</p>

<p>A: Yeah. It didn’t seem to work, though.</p>

<p>Q: How…surprising.</p>

<hr />

<p>Q: Hi…</p>

<p>A: No! Wait! You are trying to install Snow Leopard on a Macintosh computer, correct?</p>

<p>Q: Yes.</p>

<p>A: And not a big cat of any sort?</p>

<p>Q: No.</p>

<p>A: Okay. what’s your question, then?</p>

<p>Q: How do I get it into my floppy drive?</p>

<hr />

<p>Q: Hi, I am trying to upgrade OSX 10.5 to OSX 10.6 on an Intel Core 2 Duo iMac using a DVD I purchased today.</p>

<p>A: Wow! Yes! Finally! Okay, so you’re trying to upgrade, and you’re having problems?</p>

<p>Q: No, actually I lied. I finished the upgrade earlier today. It was easy.</p>

<p>A: So…. are you having problems with your new snowy leopardness?</p>

<p>Q: No, no. Everything’s fine.</p>

<p>A: Have some old PowerPC programs that don’t run any more?</p>

<p>Q: Nope.</p>

<p>A: So… Why the call?</p>

<p>Q: I’m so lonely! Let’s face it, refinements to an OS do not fill the hole in my life that craves for human contact!</p>

<p>A: Hoo boy.</p>

<p>Q: I’ve not been on a date in years! And nobody reads my blog!</p>

<p>A: Well folks, see ya next time! This could take a while. Enjoy your newly modified big cats!</p>

<p>Q: My mother called me “lasagna brain!” I never had a gerbil! Nobody even says hi to me when I sign in on WoW….</p>

<p>Shocking news from the world of Apple Fandom today as an AP poll shows that there are absolutely no surprises left for those who shell out for Apple’s newest release of OSX. </p>

<p>“The blogs have covered everything,” said an unnamed operative.<a href="#footnote_0_521" title="AP deals harshly with errant operatives.">1</a> “From really, really obvious features like the new QuickTime X to really boring things like the OpenCL framework, every single facet of Snow Leopard has been covered.  I  mean, there have been long, in-depth articles about a “malware protection system” that watches for two packages! What’s that all about?”</p>

<p>The dearth of new material on the arctic cat has left the Apple Blogging Community<a href="#footnote_1_521" title="That’s right, the ABC. What about it?">2</a> with a bit of a problem on their hands. </p>

<p>“What do we write about?  It’s still to early to start guessing on the code name for 10.7. We’ll have to wait until at least next week for that,” said Leo Laporte.</p>

<p>“I disagree,” disagreed John Gruber, who went on to claim that Apple would name 10.7 “Fireball” after his own illustrious self.</p>

<p>“Let’s face it, I put the Missing Manual to bed six months ago, and since then it’s just been trying to weasel things out from under the NDA.  Now that we’re allowed to talk about it, there’s not really anything left to cover, other than the…oops, that feature’s still under NDA, I forgot. Well, you’ll see,” said a more-smug-than-usual David Pogue.</p>

<p>Those wishing to console the despondent Apple bloggers suggested they talk about rumors of be-camera’ed<a href="#footnote_2_521" title="most over-punctuated word ever on this blog, ladies and gentlemen!">3</a> iPods or the coming Apple tablet, but these suggestions were met with moist snorts of derision.  “Out of the frying pan into the fire” was how the Macalope put it.</p>

<p>but fear not, gentle readers! CANS has found the one thing that no other blog has covered, and we will be providing exclusive coverage of that mysterious new thing, the one Apple product upgrade of which no one else knows, right after this week’s iFAQ.</p>

<p>Stay Tuned!</p>

<p>Early this morning, every member of the Apple “community”<a href="#footnote_0_513" title="defined as “people who care about OS updates”">1</a> started vibrating at about 20Hz.</p>

<p>“It’s coming!” they<a href="#footnote_1_513" title="alright, “we”">2</a> said in unison at 6:45 PDT.  Several people were heard to growl like cats.<br/>
“The 28th! That’s only (carry the one…add three…) seven days from today! No, wait, FOUR! that’s four days from now!” squealed Walt Mossberg, immediately starting his glowing review of the nascent OS. <br/>
“What? I’ve been running snow leopard for two [expeletive deleted] years now.  No big deal,” said John Gruber.<br/>
For those of us that don’t get free beta copies of unreleased releases, Friday is now officially a big deal™.  We’ll keep you posted on further developments in the community’s response as they happen.</p>
