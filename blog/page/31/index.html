<p>Sad news from the world of open source computing today as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikimania_stallman_keynote2.jpg">Richard Stallman</a>, founder of the Free Software Foundation and principle author of the GNU Public License, was put to sleep.</p>

<p>“It was for his own good, really,” remarked Eric S. Raymond.  ”He was getting, well, <em>rabid</em> is the only way to describe it.  I mean, some of the things he wanted to put into GPL 3.0 were just strange. I won’t get into specifics, but where would we even <em>find</em> a kangaroo suit in Linus Torvalds’ size?”</p>

<p>Raymond assured us that it was done in the most humane way possible. “We brought him into a nice living room with <em>Charles in Charge</em> on the TV. He loved <em>Charles in Charge</em>…” Raymond paused for a moment, his eyes moist. “Sorry…  Anyway, while he was distracted by the antics of the lovable Scott Baio and Nicole Eggert, a technician came in behind him and injected 40,000 lines of pure <em>Windows ME</em> source code into his beard.  Richard was gone before the second commercial break.”  Tears were running openly down his face at this point. “We’ll miss you, big guy.”</p>

<p>In recent months Stallman’s mental stability has weakened, as evidenced by a recent manifesto calling for a change in the name of most operating systems:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to underscore the role that GPL’d software plays in our lives, we need to convey to people the idea that the GNU foundation is at the heart of all good software. To this end we need to use the following names:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All IBM Products will be called “Prison/DOS”</li>
    <li>FreeBSD will be called “GNU/FreeBSD”</li>
    <li>OpenBSD will be called “GNU/OpenBSD”</li>
    <li>No, SERIOUSLY, call it GNU/Linux!  Stop laughing at me!  I mean it!</li>
    <li>OSX has been heavily influenced by free software.  It should be called GNU.5/OSX.  </li>
    <li>Windows will be called “Spawn of Satan”.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The manifesto continues for several more pages.</p>

<p>“We do need to remember the things that Richard has done for the community,” remarked Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. “I mean, without him there would be no open source, and the GPL version 2.0 really is a masterpiece of legal writing. But, no, it’s called Linux, not ‘GNU/Linux’, or ‘Stallman/Linux’, or ‘FSF/Linux’ or whatever unpronounceable crap he wants to call  my, I mean, ‘our’ operating system.”</p>

<p>Apple was contacted for a comment, but it was busy watching old episodes of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanie_Loves_Chachi" title="Joanie Loves Chachi">Joanie Loves Chachi</a></em>  and weeping gently to itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p><a href="http://www.yepthat.com/leap/index.html">Leap</a>, the new finder replacement by Ironic software, advertises itself as “better than the finder” at locating both the documents you were looking for and the documents that you didn’t know you were looking for.  However, further testing has proven that Leap is better at locating documents than the actual human brain, and has therefore made the user as useless as an embarrassing vestigial tail.</p>

<p>“With Leap, I no longer need to use my computer,” said tehCatz66 in an online review.  ”All my documents are so easily found, I just think about them and I’m done! Thanks, Ironic Software!”  This is thanks to Ironic’s use of Bluetooth, Bonjour, and Voodoo. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Leap you find things based on your natural memory of that file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>says the Leap website.  Macs with wireless connections can automatically connect to your brain, then pull your memories directly from your brain, thus allowing Leap to both index your brain and know what you are looking for, both consciously, as well as subconsciously in the new beta version of Leap 2.0.  ”I won’t say there haven’t been embarrassing situations with the whole ‘subconscious search’ feature,” said Ted Leckie, one of the members of the Ironic team. ”There have.  Like that time that we were demoing the product and this girl with an iPhone walked by.  Leap was searching all the customer’s minds at the time, and suddenly the screen was full of really, really shocking images. Pure lust, in it’s most graphic form.  I mean, it’s just an iPhone!  I’ve got, like, three that I purchased with the proceeds off of Yep.  Don’t tell Tom, by the way. I told him Yep tanked.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most powerful feature of Leap is the way it can </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…allow you to stumble upon not only the file you were looking for but sometimes an even better one that you weren’t looking for. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It’s totally true,” said another user, whose name I haven’t made up yet.  ”I was looking for my will, which I keep as a Pages document, and I found a letter my wife had written to my best friend.  I thought they hated each other, but  now I know that they’re, like, <em>really</em> good friends! Now I can have him over for poker on Wednesdays again! Thanks, Leap!”</p>

<p>Leap is available for only $59 from Ironic software, or if you have overclocked your Time Machine you can go back a couple of weeks and get it as part of the <a href="http://mupromo.com/">MUPromo</a> Bundle.</p>

<p><em>In 2008, a hero died. Crazy Apple Rumors Site, known by those who loved it deeply as “Jennifer Frickin’ Connely”, and to the rest of us as CARS, passed into the silent grave of <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1035">hiatus</a>**.  Since then the world of Apple-centric blogging has been barren, a wasteland of egos and self-important Grubers goobers.  Clearly it was time for a new hero to emerge (cue dramatic music, pan out to a sunrise over the crest of a hill) time for a new force in the world of made up humorous Apple news posts. And that new hero is (wait for a dramatic silhouette to rise over the crest of the hill)…ahem.  I said, “And that hero is…” (wait for it.  Someone’s got to be coming…) AND THAT HERO IS…(awww, forget it.)…Someone else, apparently.</em></p>

<p>But while you wait for a  new paragon of entertainment, you can read this site.  It’s called the Crazy Apple News Site.  You can call it CANS.  Hopefully it’ll be occasionally entertaining and cause you to want to send the editorial staff thousands of dollars worth of free merchandise.  </p>

<p>The current goal of CANS is to get popular enough to get John Gruber to say something nasty about us in person at either MacWorld Expo or WWDC.  It’s not a good goal, but hey, you gotta start somewhere. To this end, posts will be posted, and eventually weekly features will be featured.  New, made up characters will be introduced and improbable personality quirks will be attributed to various people in the Apple organization. You will laugh at our imaginary staff’s antics, smile knowingly at their misdeeds, and, eventually, come to love them.  That’s where the thousands of dollars come in, by the way.  None of this “You are soooo cool! I want to be just like you” crap.  ”You can’t buy food with ‘you are soooo cool’s” is our motto.  If you can’t express your appreciation in the form of cold hard cash or, at the very least, <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=M9720G/B">iPod Socks</a>, then you can keep your flower-child love to yourself, you dirty hippies! </p>

<p>So, um, welcome to CANS.</p>
