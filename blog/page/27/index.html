<blockquote><p><a href="#footnote_0_75" title="or to judge from our comments: Lady and Gentleman"><img src="#footnote_0_75" title="or to judge from our comments: Lady and Gentleman" alt="The Zombie of RMS" /></a></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen<a href="#footnote_0_75" title="or to judge from our comments: Lady and Gentleman">1</a>, we are just as pleased as punch to bring you our first ever Guest Editorial, and boy do we have a great one to start out with. Yes, today we are proud to publish wit and wisdom from beyond <a href="http://crazyapplenews.com/2008/05/richard-stallman-put-to-sleep/">the grave</a>. We present the undead father of Open Source, a great man and now a great zombie, please put your keyboards together for Zombie Richard M. Stallman!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>BRAAAAINS! BRAAAAAAINSSSS!</em></strong> Hahaha, sorry, little zombie joke there.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Dickson, for that lovely introduction. By the way, “Zombie Richard M. Stallman” is my mundane name, you all can call me ZRMS.  Yes, I return from an untimely death, pushed upon me by that cowardly Raymond and separatist Torvalds to let the people of the world of the living know what I think about your software development strategies.  The advantage of death is that it unclouds your vision and frees your thinking.  Suddenly I understand the appeal of Java to developers and, while I don’t agree with it, I see why so many users use Windows. But most of all I have come to love what I thought I would always hate: your little “Mac” computers.</p>

<p>I always thought that Macs were just toys for the closed-source bourgeoisie, playthings for the rich and unenlightened. But suddenly <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1044">CARS</a> is funny<a href="#footnote_1_75" title="had to sneak a trackback link in here somewhere">2</a>, and  now I see the beauty, the symmetry of using a closed source mach system on top of the stable, reliable, open source Unix foundation.  I see the elegance of two licenses for each piece of software, the beauty of not knowing when your next update will be coming out.  I also see all people as basically walking delicatessens, but again, that’s a zombie thing.</p>

<p>So does that mean that I, the reanimated corpus of RMS, have started using an iMac to do all my otherworldly programming and checking my email?  No.  I use the <em>real</em> æthernet, a network the likes of which you mortals cannot comprehend, to transmit my thoughts as data structures directly to those that need them.  It’s like wireless, but far, far spookier and cooler. Also we get, like, 9800GBps transfer rates, so my BitTorrent ratio has gone up quite a bit.</p>

<p>Sorry, wandered a bit from my point there.  My point is that there is so much more to worry about in life other than how “open” your license is, how much you can do to absolutely mod your OS to your exact tastes, and that all the time we spent being rabid about the Firefox logo not being 100% free seems kinda silly now.  I mean, eventually you have to use that computer for something, right? Sure <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> kicks Windows all round the block in terms of speed and stabilizability, and sure freedom of computers is important, and someone needs to keep Microsoft in check, but there does come a point where enough is sufficient, and you just need to stop recompiling your kernel and write that thesis paper you’ve been avoiding all semester.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I didn’t think this way when I was alive.  Chemicals, probably.  When you’re alive you have all this adrenalin, testosterone, endorphins, and all that other chemical muck swilling around inside of you, screwing up your thinking and making you want to hit things all day long.  Or something.  Ever since I was brought back to this plane by that itinerant Voodoo priest my memories of my past life are somewhat confused.  I mean, I know that I didn’t like someone called Bill Gates, and every once in a while I suddenly remember  being really happy writing code to be compatible with the 80386 processor, but I don’t really remember why I did like 80386′s and didn’t like Gates.</p>

<p>Guess what I use computers for now. Go on, guess.  I use them to tell really <em>awesome</em> zombie jokes.  Wanna hear some?  C’mon, be a sport. No?  Fine. Be that way. I’ma go eat Steve Ballmer’s brain.  I could use a light snack.</p>

<p>HA! <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/snuck.html">Sneaked</a> a zombie joke right past you! <em>ZING!</em></p>

<p>No, okay, I was being serious. I’m hungry. Later, fruit lovers.</p>

<p>Every Friday<a href="#footnote_0_73" title="It’s still Friday in the Mountain Time Zone">1</a>  we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and<br/>
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy<br/>
Apple products.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each week, we have declared August<strong> iLife Month</strong>. Every Friday this month we will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This week: iPhoto</p>

<p>Q: Why should I use iPhoto?</p>

<p>A: iPhoto allows you to store and sort all your photos in style, keeping your memories tightly and rigidly organized, with no chance of one spilling over into another.</p>

<p>Q: That sounds draconian!</p>

<p>A: You bet!</p>

<p>Q: What if I want to store one photo in two different events?</p>

<p>A: No, you can’t.  But you can create albums to  organize your photos from different events, and with your Mobile Me account–</p>

<p>Q: I don’t have a Mobile Me…</p>

<p>A: YES YOU DO HAVE A MOBILE ME ACCOUNT! ALL APPLE USERS MUST HAVE MOBILE ME ACCOUNTS! HOW CAN YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT MOSTLY-WORKING-NOW SYNC AND PUSH EMAIL?</p>

<p>Q: AAAGH!  “Sync and push email?” That just doesn’t sound good. Also, we did this joke last week.<a href="#footnote_1_73" title="and we’ll probably do it again next week!">2</a></p>

<p>A: Sorry, I forgot. I don’t read iFAQ’s.  Anyway, if you <em>did</em> have a Mobile Me account, you would be able to share your pictures on the web in Mobile Me galleries, to which other people would be able to add their pictures, and all your families and friends would have a nice gallery full of shared images.</p>

<p>Q: Hey that would be great! and for only $99 a year!</p>

<p>A: Yeah!</p>

<p>Q: Hey, I have another question: I heard that you can print books from iPhoto. How does that work?</p>

<p>A: It couldn’t be simpler! just open iPhoto, choose the “book” option at the bottom, and put images into the placeholders on the virtual book pages in front of you. When you’re done, click “order book” and Apple will print your book to your specifications and send it to you, or to whomever you wish.</p>

<p>Q: Hey, that’s great! Now I finally have an easy way to publish that book of pictures I took of my own armpit!</p>

<p>A:That’s…great…?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, I have all these pictures I took over time, so  I have pictures of my armpit as a kid, as a teenager, that one time when I got that bad rash, that other time when I got a worse rash, the time I… well, why am I telling you all this when I can just show you! Here, look!</p>

<p>A: Oh my… I’m gonna… *erp*</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, that’s a good one! Hey, I can make a full hardcover, with dust jacket!</p>

<p>A: Why would you want an <em>armpit book</em>?</p>

<p>Q: Oh, it’s not for me!  I’d send it to my friends for Christmas!  Gosh, thanks Apple!</p>

<p>A: We’re so glad that Apple products allow you to… share… your… look, Apple has a reputation to maintain. We want people to think all Apple users are surfers or snowboarders.  Please don’t make an armpit book using iPhoto!  That’s what places like <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu.com</a> are for.</p>

<p>Q: …And I’m done! Okay, it’s off to the printers! Wow, these Apple programs are great!  So classy and refined. And thank you for your help, iFAQ writer person!  I’m so grateful, I’m sending you a copy too!</p>

<p>A: I can hardly wait.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and<br/>
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy<br/>
Apple products.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This week we start with the most popular and used member of the suite: iWeb.</p>

<p>Q: Is iWeb hard to use?</p>

<p>A: Like all iLife products, iWeb is a simple solution that allows anyone to publish their life to the Web. You can publish blogs, movies, photo galleries and more, all without writing a single line of code.</p>

<p>Q: What if I want to write my own code?</p>

<p>A: Please, not to make us laugh. You. Want to write. Your own code. Go ahead on there, Mr. Webmaster. I’m sure your site will look WAAAY better than the themes that Apple paid thousands and thousands of dollars to have developed. Yep, have fun with those  tags!</p>

<p>Q: So I should just stick to the pre-defined themes?</p>

<p>A: That would be best.</p>

<p>Q: Apple paid thousands of dollars to have someone develop a black screen with a reflection under any picture?</p>

<p>A: You try making that reflection! It’s really hard!</p>

<p>Q: Uh huh.</p>

<p>A: Did you have any other questions, or just snide remarks?</p>

<p>Q: Right, sorry. Okay, next question: I don’t have a Mobile Me account–</p>

<p>A: WHAT? Why not!?!</p>

<p>Q: Whoa, easy there, mister punctuation!</p>

<p>A: Why don’t you have a Mobile Me account!?</p>

<p>Q: Hey! I’m the “Question” guy! Stop asking me questions! I don’t have a Mobile Me account because I don’t want to pay $100 a year for web hosting. And my question is: Can I host an iWeb site on something other than Mobile Me?</p>

<p>A: No.</p>

<p>Q: Really?</p>

<p>A: I don’t know if I should even be talking to you, you heretic.</p>

<p>Q: C’mon, don’t be like that. Give us a little smile!</p>

<p>A: No, stop it *sigh* oohhh, you know I can’t stay mad at you. But I don’t know if I should answer your little question.</p>

<p>Q: Hey, be a pal. I’ll be your best friend!</p>

<p>A: All right, all right. Yes, you can host an iWeb site on any web host using a program like Panic’s <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> to upload the files. There. Are you happy now?</p>

<p>Q: Yep! Thanks!</p>

<p>A: Fine. Anything else?</p>

<p>Q: Yes. STOP ASKING QUESTIONS! I’m the guy with the “Q” in front of my lines!</p>

<p>A: Sorry.</p>

<p>Q: That’s better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>With the release of the iPhone 3G, we were excited to read Walt Mossberg’s review of the new and improved hardware and software offerings from Apple. As he has with so many other new releases, Walt praised the iPhone in general and the App Store specifically, but we wanted more.<br/>
I mean, look at his <a href="http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080605/mozilla-firefox-30-is-the-best-browser-for-web-for-now/">review of Firefox 3</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Firefox 3.0 is the best Web browser out there right now, and that it tops the current versions of both IE and Safari in features, speed and security.
Or how about his review of <a href="http://solution.allthingsd.com/20080722/a-shopping-trip-to-the-app-store-for-your-iphone/">the App store</a>:<br/>
compared with the graphically rich, snappy iPhone apps — many of which fetch data from the Internet at high speed — the typical program on these older platforms [Palm and Blackberrry] looks positively primitive.
But his latest review of the iPhone itself, well, it was…<br/>
it was kinda <em>negative</em>. And we just can’t handle that.</p></blockquote>

<p>I mean sure, he calls it “a true computing platform with wide versatility” and “the world’s most influential smart phone”. But he also complains about the battery life, talks about it having problems with syncing email from Exchange and other systems, and he says that it’s more expensive due to AT&amp;T’s increased prices.</p>

<p>How do you think that makes Apple feel, Walt? You can’t blame Apple for some battery supplier’s problems, or Microsoft’s terrible Exchange system, or AT&amp;T’s pricing schemes. These things aren’t Apple’s fault!</p>

<p>And what about us, the consumers? What we want from you is happy –nay, ebullient– reviews of new products so we can feel good about spending all our money on things we don’t need and keep the economy from going in the toilet. And you give us objectivity. Great. Thanks. We can get that from bankers or lawyers.</p>

<p>So fine, you don’t absolutely love the iPhone 3G. Great. I guess we can deal with that, Mr. Mossberg. Just don’t say anything nasty about our good, beloved, almost-working <a href="http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080723/apples-mobileme-is-far-too-flawed-to-be-reliable/">Mobile Me</a>…<br/>
Oh, you <em>rat</em>.</p>

<p>Every Sunday<a href="#footnote_0_61" title="If we have had contractors in our house Headquarters all day Friday and Saturday">1</a> we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help<br/>
you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>Today: The person who just installed our carpet<a href="#footnote_1_61" title="and made a 4 hour job take two days">2</a> answers your questions about using DSL to connect a Mac to the internet.</p>

<p>Q: I’ve heard that cable is faster than DSL, is that true?</p>

<p>A: Oh, I don’t know, and speed isn’t all that important, you know? But I have a cousin who can install cable for you.</p>

<p>Q: What’s the best way to find a reliable service provider in the state where I live?</p>

<p>A: My brother runs a business that will get you hooked up reeeeeal niiiice, if you know what I’m sayin’.</p>

<p>Q: I’m not sure I do, nor do I want to. Who is that old guy that came with you, why doesn’t he do anything, and why did he just cut a perfectly good six-foot piece of carpet into two three-foot pieces of carpet?</p>

<p>A: That’s my dad, no? And we need the smaller pieces to finish the small room, right? So, we will do it really quick, after we go take a break and talk about it for a while. Then we will look in all your closets.</p>

<p>Q: So, do you think you would be able to, oh, I don’t know, put my phone jack back on the wall, so that I can connect to the internet <a href="#footnote_2_61" title="DSL uses phone lines. CANS don’t do dial-up">3</a> anytime soon, considering that the jack is four feet above the ground in a room you’ve <em>already finished</em>?</p>

<p>A: Oh, see, we need to keep it off, and it’s not in our contract to put things like doors or phone jacks back. But I have a brother-in-law who owns a company that does that sort of thing. I can give you his number.</p>

<p>Q: When will you be finished, and how did you break my Logitech keyboard, which was in a drawer in the garage, where we don’t even have carpet going in? Do you know how much I hate this old white Apple keyboard?</p>

<p>A: We’re done, so will you please sign this invoice that’s for another house we’re doing in two days? We don’t like keeping our paperwork straight. I have a sister who works for Logitech-</p>

<p>Q: OUT! Get out!</p>

<p>Microsoft has launched the first wave of their <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/22/microsoft_offers_first_hints_at_anti_apple_marketing_blitz_for_vista.html">$300 million advertising campaign</a> set to counter the “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” ads in an unlikely form.</p>

<p>“How’s that game playing going, Mac freaks?” asks <a href="http://www.se51.net/devnull/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/steve_ballmer2.jpg">Steve Ballmer</a> in a form letter sent to every “@apple.com” email address. “Oh, and <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>? Your Open Source software sucks! I mean, check out <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.Net</a>! That’s some Open Source software worth using, lemme tell ya!”</p>

<p>Needless to say, this quixotic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Rose">Tokyo Rose</a> style spam attack was devastating to the morale of Apple employees. “Ooooh, Stevie, them’s fightin’ words,” said Jonathan Ive, SVP of Industrial Design at Apple. “I mean, picking on our <em>open source development</em>? Wow, that’s hitting us where it hurts, pal. What’s next, a criticism of our favorite brand of floor wax? Please, not that!”</p>

<p>Peter Oppenheimer asked, “How much of your $300 million did you spend on writing this email?” Reports that Steve Jobs had to physically restrain <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> and Steve Wozniack<a href="#footnote_0_46" title="neither of whom work at Apple but both of whom have @apple.com email addresses due to tremendous whining">1</a> from “hopping on their Segways and giving Ballmer a piece of their mind” are as yet unverified.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs’ response was typically refined. In an email response he writes: “Wow, Ballmer. That’s quite some attack, and it hurts. It hurts almost as much as our 30% profit increase this quarter. I guess the “wow” really does “start now”, only a year after you launched Vista. Wow, indeed.”</p>

<p>For once, it was Microsoft who had no comment, except to remind us that they could “(expletive deleted) crush” the Crazy Apple News Site, which is entirely true.</p>

<p>In an unrelated side note, we here at CANS have just uninstalled Vista from Boot Camp on our iMac and installed XP instead.  It is surprisingly more stable.</p>

<p>Q: Excel 2007 has this cool feature on Windows where you can just set a range of colors for a range of values and it will apply conditional formatting to a column. Can you do that in Excel 2008?</p>

<p>A: Black is the color of my soul,<br/>
Dripping sadness runs through my hair and stains the ground with my agony.<br/>
I cannot move my hands; the weight of my soul has surpassed my will.</p>

<p>Q: Word seems to take a long time to load on my mac mini, even with 2GB of RAM. What can I do to speed it up?</p>

<p>A: I sink into the flood of your hate in the Cathedral of the Indifferent,<br/>
the black candles casting raven-fluttering shadows as I try escape.<br/>
But alas! I cannot run as fast as my eyeliner runs in my tears.</p>

<p>Q: Will PowerPoint ever <em>not</em> suck?</p>

<p>A: Cruel, sharpenéd lights stab my eyes!<br/>
Hardened heart, darkened soul, turn from my feelings!<br/>
Hot Topic stopped carrying leather pants in my size<br/>
And I can no longer fit in my old ones.</p>

<p>Q: Um… Entourage?</p>

<p>A: But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br/>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br/>
A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br/>
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover<img src="#footnote_0_43" title=" Samuel Taylor Coleridge is the ultimate goth poet" alt="1" /></p>

<p>This is just a little note to tell you that the only-slightly-sane Ruby Ninja Androids upgraded CANS to WordPress 2.6 today. Let us know if you see any little bugs.  But not big bugs. Those scare us.</p>

<p><img src="http://crazyapplenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/new-idisk.png" title="The new Prettiest Princess look of iDisk" alt="iDisk is now the prettiest princess!" />Apple took iDisk in a new direction with the release of Mobile Me.<br/>
For years, the iDisk icon has been the now-all-too-familiar “some kinda network-magic-ball” on a hard disk, suggesting that an iDisk is, well, a hard drive on the network (or possibly the other way around. I’m not sure.) Now, however, the iDisk icon invites you to explore something entirely new. Specifically, it invites you to explore worlds where you can ride with your improbably-proportioned friends on a magical wingéd horse named Feathers into a fluffy cloudy mauve external disk in the sky.<br/>
This is a movement sure to be met well with the under-12 crowd, a group that makes up a significant number of Apple computer purchasers.<br/>
“I like it a lot!!!!!!” said a person who was not allowed to tell me their name because “Mommy said I shouldn’t talk to bloggers”. “It’s a cool new picture, and I can store all my paintings of princesses on it! It’s so pretty! I named it “pretty fairy”! And I like the prple [sic] color too!”<br/>
While we at CANS would never admit it, using the new iDisk makes us feel like royalty. <em>Pretty</em> royalty. Not, like, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales">Prince Charles</a> or anything.</p>

<p><em>As an apology for not posting the Friday iFAQ on Friday, I present to you: Vista Bullying</em></p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.crn.com/it-channel/208803174">widely</a> <a href="http://www.dynaverse.net/forum/index.php/topic,163381520.msg1122890622.html">reported</a> <a href="http://maschke1506.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/microsoft-the-vista-bullying-stops-here-it-channel-it-channel-news-by-crn-and-varbusiness/">move</a>,<a href="#footnote_0_37" title="that last one is the funniest ">1</a> <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Vista-SP1-the-Truth-and-Nothing-But-the-Truth-89817.shtml">Microsoft</a> has announced that the “Vista Bullying stops here”.  And we here at CANS think it’s about time, too.  I mean, look at poor little Microsoft, barely making enough money to keep every single human being on earth fed, and along come big ol’ Apple, throwing its weight around, making Vista feel bad. Be nice to Microsoft! They’re doing their best, folks!  They don’t have all that many programmers in Redmond, and making an operating system is hard! Why does Apple have to be so mean, anyway?  All Vista wants to do is take over the world and make everyone have to buy <a href="http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/onecare_default.htm?WT.srch=1">OneCare</a> to patch all the security holes left in the original operating system.  Is that so bad?</p>

<p>But as much fun as it is to paint Microsoft as a spoiled, whiny little nine year old getting pushed around by a much cooler five year old, It’s even more fun to look at some of the comments they actually made in the announcement:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, the changes did cause a lot of pain.</p></blockquote>

<p>What’s funny is that the full stop did go there.  (In the interest of fair reporting<a href="#footnote_1_37" title="I do that sometimes">2</a> I should mention that the next line was “But the customers are starting to see benefits.”) Microsoft acknowledges that using Vista causes pain, and that it’s only a year later that “customers are <em>starting</em> to see benefits.”   I…I just don’t have anything to say to that, but I will mention that when I took a class that required me to write software in Visual Studio, I got a “are you sure you want to run this program?” warning <em>every time</em> I started Visual Studio, itself a Microsoft product.  My guess is that Microsoft wanted to let me know that if I run VS, I could write a virus, which would then infect my machine and destroy all my data.</p>

<p>And then there’s this comment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Brooks noted that the same architectural changes that caused hardships in Vista are carrying over to Windows 7…</p></blockquote>

<p>What they mean to say is that the hardships are over, because all the changes were made in Vista, so Windows 7 should be a breeze.  What it sounds like is “All the hardships in Vista are carrying over to Windows 7″, which is way funnier.</p>

<p>One more:</p>

<blockquote><p>You thought the sleeping giant was still sleeping. We’ve woken up and it’s time to take this message forward. This is the true story of Vista…</p></blockquote>

<p>Ahh, pure marketing speak.  Take one metaphor, muddle it up with some other vaguely fairy-tale sounding phrases, and then “take your message forward”.  The great thing about this sentence is that it doesn’t actually mean anything! Asimov would have called it “syntactically null”.  But it sounds like big news.</p>

<p>Now, I have to say that the “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” ads are getting on my nerves.  So if those went away, I’d be happy. But all this whining about “people is bein’ mean to us fer no reason” is pretty silly, and isn’t going to get Microsoft any credibility in the market, especially while they’re running their own <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3600724.stm">smear</a> campaigns against <a href="http://www.thejemreport.com/content/view/220/">Linux</a>.</p>

<p>Well, this didn’t end up being as funny as I’d hoped, but one of the first rules of comedy is that it isn’t funny to make fun of something that’s already a joke.</p>
