<p>Microsoft feels that the best way to counteract the market’s move towards Apple products is to hire <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26327409/">Jerry Seinfeld</a> to appear with Bill Gates<a href="#footnote_0_98" title="How long should I wait until I start calling him things like “Dorky McSweatervest”?  Is that toothbrush still in use?">1</a>  in an attempt to get people to take Vista seriously.</p>

<p>Well, this makes perfect sense to us here at CANS.  I mean, look at how much Apple’s stock has gone up in the last few months since CANS went live!  Clearly, there is a link between the number of people who make jokes about a computing platform and how popular it is.</p>

<p>The great thing is that we all know this is only the beginning. If this Seinfeld thing works at all, they’ll buy up every comedian they can get, and I for one can’t wait.  Personally, I’m hoping that <a href="http://www.poprock80s.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/carrottop.jpg">Carrot</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_Top">Top</a> is the next one tapped to hawk Mr. Ballmer’s wares. I feel his painful, grating voice and irritatingly over-the-top appearance would make him the truest face of Windows Vista. The fact that he seems to be putting on insane amounts of muscle–presumably to get people to stop making fun of him–only adds to the appeal. But until that’s official, why don’t we all guess about it for a while. Make this a more interactive post for once.  Why don’t you all talk about it? Who do you think Microsoft should hire to try to make Apple look less attractive?</p>

<p>Talk amongst yourselves.</p>

Apple products.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each<br />
week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we<br />
will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This Week: iDVD</p>

<p>Q: Ummm…. I really can’t think of any questions about iDVD.  I mean, it’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it?</p>

<p>A: Is it?  Maybe there are more questions than you thought.</p>

<p>Q: No, not really.  I mean, you do all the hard work in iMovie, so when you export it into iDVD all you really have to do is choose a menu style and you’re golden.</p>

<p>A: That <em>may</em> be true.  Or perhaps… perhaps your limited mind isn’t ready for the awesome power that is iDVD.</p>

<p>Q: Hmmm… Nope, nope, I just read the iDVD help file. I don’t see any “awesome power” section.  Just different ways to set up menus.</p>

<p>A: Perhaps you are asking the wrong sort of question to fully unlock the grandeur of iDVD.</p>

<p>Q: I think I would need to unlock the grammar of that sentence first.</p>

<p>A: That’s the pot calling the kettle stupid<a href="#footnote_0_95" title=" Yes, I know how the saying is supposed to go. I just changed it for slightly comedic effect. Please don’t go around correcting my aphorisms.">1</a> .  But go. I see you are not yet ready. You do not have the thirst for knowledge, for ultimate DVD-authoring power, that marks one of the truly prepared users of <strong>iDVD: Master of Secrets</strong>.</p>

<p>Q: Whoa whoa whoa, no fair giving programs subtitles all willy-nilly<a href="#footnote_1_95" title="Did you know that “willy-nilly is a corrupted form of “will he or nill he”? Now you know what that ridiculous word means!">2</a>. Besides, “<strong>iDVD: Master of Secrets</strong>“? Sounds like some kind of stupid B science fiction sequel.</p>

<p>A: Those who mock iDVD are not ready for its secrets. I will answer no more questions today. Farewell.</p>

<p>Q: Well, actually I did have one question…</p>

<p>A: Really? Okay! I’ll answer it! What’s your question? Tell me tell me!</p>

<p>Q: Gotcha!  I don’t actually have a question about <strong>iDVD: The Most Straightforward Program</strong>.  I just wanted to see how long you could hold out not answering a question.</p>

<p>A: Ahem. Yes, begone with you! No longer may you insult the oracle of iDVD’s power.  I shall return now to… oh whatever. I’m going home. Jerk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Since the launch of the new Mobile Me platform Apple has extended all users’ accounts by at least 90 days, as an apology for the flawed and awkward rollout process. But that just isn’t enough for Steve Jobs, who in a recent meeting decided that the executive board of Apple need to take this “to the next level” and personally apologize to each and every Mobile Me subscriber by bringing them a plate of cookies.</p>

<p>“Starting this Friday, the entire executive team will be out delivering cookies to those whom we have inconvenienced through this Mobile Me launch process,” states an internal memo that was leaked to CANS early this morning.  Our inside source says that Jobs “feels deeply” for all the people who have “had to live without being able to push their calendars to their iPhones and their MacBooks in the same minute” and would like to make it up to them.</p>

<p>This move has been well received by the pundit community.  “It’ll be nice to see Steve Jobs again,” says Merlin Mann, “I mean, I see him all the time already, ’cause he’s always hanging out at my house. But, you know, he’s been busy lately and hasn’t had time to drop by for a while. But we’re totally friends. I’m serious.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the various Apple execs are working on their individual door approaches.  From Jobs’ typically restrained “We’re sorry that we failed you, here’s some insanely great cookies” to Phil Shiller’s “these cookies are a financially insignificant way to let you know that we care for you personally,” the entire board is working on letting people know that Apple values them and feels their pain.</p>

<p>Details have not surfaced about the size or quantity of the cookies to be distributed, but some blurry photos that could be from the Apple Kitchen reveal the cookies to be Oatmeal Raisin.</p>

<p>We continue this week with iMovie: the program that makes you look like George Lucas<a href="#footnote_0_70" title="minus the facial hair">1</a> .</p>

<p>Q: I would like to add a transition between two scenes of movie I’m creating.</p>

<p>A: Okay, that’s easy. All you have to do is–</p>

<p>Q: D’ya wanna know what it’s about?</p>

<p>A: NO! No, no, no, nonono, no, huh-uh, nope, no, um… not right now, no.  Thank you though! Let’s just show you how to do transitions. What you do is select the scene that you want the transition to come after and–</p>

<p>Q: It’s a space pirate ninja elf romance.</p>

<p>A: Aaaaiiegh! I said I didn’t want to know what it was about!  What’s your title, “Overused Internet Trope Story”? Wait, no, forget I asked I don’t want–</p>

<p>Q: It’s called “I CAN HAS ASTEROIDZ??? I HAS A BUKKIT!”</p>

<p>A: Oh merciful heavens…</p>

<p>Q: The hero is kinda this fox guy, like in that old video game? Anyway, he’s got a first officer who’s a cat girl named–</p>

<p>A: You mixed StarFox and Furries into your sick little production?</p>

<p>Q: Ummmm… yes? So anyway, they meet this ninja space bat named Gwylindor, and he’s got a ninja master who–</p>

<p>A: Nope, nope, nope. Not listening. Go. Just go.  You don’t want iMovie, you want Windows Movie Maker. Now get out.</p>

<p>Q: …A ninja master who is a half-elf half-</p>

<p>A: <em>I don’t want to know</em>. Come on, up you get. I’m sure if you leave now you won’t get caught in traffic. Bye now!</p>

<p>Q: Anyway, I want to share it online with all my friends that helped make it last month after renfest, but…</p>

<p>A: Oh, hey, weren’t you just leaving?  Okay, well, see you later then! Here, I’ll get your hat.</p>

<p>Q: …So I want to share it online, but, um, I don’t have a Mobile Me account! I’ll bet that gets you angry!</p>

<p>A: Thank the stars. Mobile Me has had enough troubles without your little geekfest. Come back when you’re making movies about your stylish road trip to Vancouver. Then we’ll talk.</p>

<p>Q: I took a trip to Lindon the other day. Does that count?</p>

<p>A: Bye now!</p>

  <p>[![The Zombie of RMS][2]][2]</p>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen[1][2], we are just as pleased as punch to bring you our first ever Guest Editorial, and boy do we have a great one to start out with. Yes, today we are proud to publish wit and wisdom from beyond [the grave][3]. We present the undead father of Open Source, a great man and now a great zombie, please put your keyboards together for Zombie Richard M. Stallman!</p>

<p><strong><em>BRAAAAINS! BRAAAAAAINSSSS!</em></strong> Hahaha, sorry, little zombie joke there.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Dickson, for that lovely introduction. By the way, “Zombie Richard M. Stallman” is my mundane name, you all can call me ZRMS.  Yes, I return from an untimely death, pushed upon me by that cowardly Raymond and separatist Torvalds to let the people of the world of the living know what I think about your software development strategies.  The advantage of death is that it unclouds your vision and frees your thinking.  Suddenly I understand the appeal of Java to developers and, while I don’t agree with it, I see why so many users use Windows. But most of all I have come to love what I thought I would always hate: your little “Mac” computers.</p>

<p>I always thought that Macs were just toys for the closed-source bourgeoisie, playthings for the rich and unenlightened. But suddenly <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=1044">CARS</a> is funny<a href="#footnote_1_75" title="had to sneak a trackback link in here somewhere">2</a>, and  now I see the beauty, the symmetry of using a closed source mach system on top of the stable, reliable, open source Unix foundation.  I see the elegance of two licenses for each piece of software, the beauty of not knowing when your next update will be coming out.  I also see all people as basically walking delicatessens, but again, that’s a zombie thing.</p>

<p>So does that mean that I, the reanimated corpus of RMS, have started using an iMac to do all my otherworldly programming and checking my email?  No.  I use the <em>real</em> æthernet, a network the likes of which you mortals cannot comprehend, to transmit my thoughts as data structures directly to those that need them.  It’s like wireless, but far, far spookier and cooler. Also we get, like, 9800GBps transfer rates, so my BitTorrent ratio has gone up quite a bit.</p>

<p>Sorry, wandered a bit from my point there.  My point is that there is so much more to worry about in life other than how “open” your license is, how much you can do to absolutely mod your OS to your exact tastes, and that all the time we spent being rabid about the Firefox logo not being 100% free seems kinda silly now.  I mean, eventually you have to use that computer for something, right? Sure <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> kicks Windows all round the block in terms of speed and stabilizability, and sure freedom of computers is important, and someone needs to keep Microsoft in check, but there does come a point where enough is sufficient, and you just need to stop recompiling your kernel and write that thesis paper you’ve been avoiding all semester.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I didn’t think this way when I was alive.  Chemicals, probably.  When you’re alive you have all this adrenalin, testosterone, endorphins, and all that other chemical muck swilling around inside of you, screwing up your thinking and making you want to hit things all day long.  Or something.  Ever since I was brought back to this plane by that itinerant Voodoo priest my memories of my past life are somewhat confused.  I mean, I know that I didn’t like someone called Bill Gates, and every once in a while I suddenly remember  being really happy writing code to be compatible with the 80386 processor, but I don’t really remember why I did like 80386′s and didn’t like Gates.</p>

<p>Guess what I use computers for now. Go on, guess.  I use them to tell really <em>awesome</em> zombie jokes.  Wanna hear some?  C’mon, be a sport. No?  Fine. Be that way. I’ma go eat Steve Ballmer’s brain.  I could use a light snack.</p>

<p>HA! <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/snuck.html">Sneaked</a> a zombie joke right past you! <em>ZING!</em></p>

<p>No, okay, I was being serious. I’m hungry. Later, fruit lovers.</p>

<p>Every Friday<a href="#footnote_0_73" title="It’s still Friday in the Mountain Time Zone">1</a>  we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and<br />
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy<br />
Apple products.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each week, we have declared August** iLife Month**. Every Friday this month we will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This week: iPhoto</p>

<p>Q: Why should I use iPhoto?</p>

<p>A: iPhoto allows you to store and sort all your photos in style, keeping your memories tightly and rigidly organized, with no chance of one spilling over into another.</p>

<p>Q: That sounds draconian!</p>

<p>A: You bet!</p>

<p>Q: What if I want to store one photo in two different events?</p>

<p>A: No, you can’t.  But you can create albums to  organize your photos from different events, and with your Mobile Me account–</p>

<p>Q: I don’t have a Mobile Me…</p>

<p>A: YES YOU DO HAVE A MOBILE ME ACCOUNT! ALL APPLE USERS MUST HAVE MOBILE ME ACCOUNTS! HOW CAN YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT MOSTLY-WORKING-NOW SYNC AND PUSH EMAIL?</p>

<p>Q: AAAGH!  “Sync and push email?” That just doesn’t sound good. Also, we did this joke last week.<a href="#footnote_1_73" title="and we’ll probably do it again next week!">2</a></p>

<p>A: Sorry, I forgot. I don’t read iFAQ’s.  Anyway, if you <em>did</em> have a Mobile Me account, you would be able to share your pictures on the web in Mobile Me galleries, to which other people would be able to add their pictures, and all your families and friends would have a nice gallery full of shared images.</p>

<p>Q: Hey that would be great! and for only $99 a year!</p>

<p>A: Yeah!</p>

<p>Q: Hey, I have another question: I heard that you can print books from iPhoto. How does that work?</p>

<p>A: It couldn’t be simpler! just open iPhoto, choose the “book” option at the bottom, and put images into the placeholders on the virtual book pages in front of you. When you’re done, click “order book” and Apple will print your book to your specifications and send it to you, or to whomever you wish.</p>

<p>Q: Hey, that’s great! Now I finally have an easy way to publish that book of pictures I took of my own armpit!</p>

<p>A:That’s…great…?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, I have all these pictures I took over time, so  I have pictures of my armpit as a kid, as a teenager, that one time when I got that bad rash, that other time when I got a worse rash, the time I… well, why am I telling you all this when I can just show you! Here, look!</p>

<p>A: Oh my… I’m gonna… *erp*</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, that’s a good one! Hey, I can make a full hardcover, with dust jacket!</p>

<p>A: Why would you want an <em>armpit book</em>?</p>

<p>Q: Oh, it’s not for me!  I’d send it to my friends for Christmas!  Gosh, thanks Apple!</p>

<p>A: We’re so glad that Apple products allow you to… share… your… look, Apple has a reputation to maintain. We want people to think all Apple users are surfers or snowboarders.  Please don’t make an armpit book using iPhoto!  That’s what places like <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu.com</a> are for.</p>

<p>Q: …And I’m done! Okay, it’s off to the printers! Wow, these Apple programs are great!  So classy and refined. And thank you for your help, iFAQ writer person!  I’m so grateful, I’m sending you a copy too!</p>

<p>A: I can hardly wait.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This week we start with the most popular and used member of the suite: iWeb.</p>

<p>Q: Is iWeb hard to use?</p>

<p>A: Like all iLife products, iWeb is a simple solution that allows anyone to publish their life to the Web. You can publish blogs, movies, photo galleries and more, all without writing a single line of code.</p>

<p>Q: What if I want to write my own code?</p>

<p>A: Please, not to make us laugh. You. Want to write. Your own code. Go ahead on there, Mr. Webmaster. I’m sure your site will look WAAAY better than the themes that Apple paid thousands and thousands of dollars to have developed. Yep, have fun with those  tags!</p>

<p>Q: So I should just stick to the pre-defined themes?</p>

<p>A: That would be best.</p>

<p>Q: Apple paid thousands of dollars to have someone develop a black screen with a reflection under any picture?</p>

<p>A: You try making that reflection! It’s really hard!</p>

<p>Q: Uh huh.</p>

<p>A: Did you have any other questions, or just snide remarks?</p>

<p>Q: Right, sorry. Okay, next question: I don’t have a Mobile Me account–</p>

<p>A: WHAT? Why not!?!</p>

<p>Q: Whoa, easy there, mister punctuation!</p>

<p>A: Why don’t you have a Mobile Me account!?</p>

<p>Q: Hey! I’m the “Question” guy! Stop asking me questions! I don’t have a Mobile Me account because I don’t want to pay $100 a year for web hosting. And my question is: Can I host an iWeb site on something other than Mobile Me?</p>

<p>A: No.</p>

<p>Q: Really?</p>

<p>A: I don’t know if I should even be talking to you, you heretic.</p>

<p>Q: C’mon, don’t be like that. Give us a little smile!</p>

<p>A: No, stop it *sigh* oohhh, you know I can’t stay mad at you. But I don’t know if I should answer your little question.</p>

<p>Q: Hey, be a pal. I’ll be your best friend!</p>

<p>A: All right, all right. Yes, you can host an iWeb site on any web host using a program like Panic’s <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> to upload the files. There. Are you happy now?</p>

<p>Q: Yep! Thanks!</p>

<p>A: Fine. Anything else?</p>

<p>Q: Yes. STOP ASKING QUESTIONS! I’m the guy with the “Q” in front of my lines!</p>

<p>A: Sorry.</p>

<p>Q: That’s better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>With the release of the iPhone 3G, we were excited to read Walt Mossberg’s review of the new and improved hardware and software offerings from Apple. As he has with so many other new releases, Walt praised the iPhone in general and the App Store specifically, but we wanted more.<br />
I mean, look at his <a href="http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080605/mozilla-firefox-30-is-the-best-browser-for-web-for-now/">review of Firefox 3</a>:<br />
&gt; Firefox 3.0 is the best Web browser out there right now, and that it tops the current versions of both IE and Safari in features, speed and security.
Or how about his review of <a href="http://solution.allthingsd.com/20080722/a-shopping-trip-to-the-app-store-for-your-iphone/">the App store</a>:<br />
&gt; compared with the graphically rich, snappy iPhone apps — many of which fetch data from the Internet at high speed — the typical program on these older platforms [Palm and Blackberrry] looks positively primitive.
But his latest review of the iPhone itself, well, it was…<br />
it was kinda <em>negative</em>. And we just can’t handle that.</p>

<p>I mean sure, he calls it “a true computing platform with wide versatility” and “the world’s most influential smart phone”. But he also complains about the battery life, talks about it having problems with syncing email from Exchange and other systems, and he says that it’s more expensive due to AT&amp;T’s increased prices. </p>

<p>How do you think that makes Apple feel, Walt? You can’t blame Apple for some battery supplier’s problems, or Microsoft’s terrible Exchange system, or AT&amp;T’s pricing schemes. These things aren’t Apple’s fault! </p>

<p>And what about us, the consumers? What we want from you is happy –nay, ebullient– reviews of new products so we can feel good about spending all our money on things we don’t need and keep the economy from going in the toilet. And you give us objectivity. Great. Thanks. We can get that from bankers or lawyers. </p>

<p>So fine, you don’t absolutely love the iPhone 3G. Great. I guess we can deal with that, Mr. Mossberg. Just don’t say anything nasty about our good, beloved, almost-working <a href="http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080723/apples-mobileme-is-far-too-flawed-to-be-reliable/">Mobile Me</a>…<br />
Oh, you <em>rat</em>.</p>

<p>Every Sunday<a href="#footnote_0_61" title="If we have had contractors in our house Headquarters all day Friday and Saturday">1</a> we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help<br />
you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>Today: The person who just installed our carpet<a href="#footnote_1_61" title="and made a 4 hour job take two days">2</a> answers your questions about using DSL to connect a Mac to the internet.</p>

<p>Q: I’ve heard that cable is faster than DSL, is that true?</p>

<p>A: Oh, I don’t know, and speed isn’t all that important, you know? But I have a cousin who can install cable for you.</p>

<p>Q: What’s the best way to find a reliable service provider in the state where I live?</p>

<p>A: My brother runs a business that will get you hooked up reeeeeal niiiice, if you know what I’m sayin’.</p>

<p>Q: I’m not sure I do, nor do I want to. Who is that old guy that came with you, why doesn’t he do anything, and why did he just cut a perfectly good six-foot piece of carpet into two three-foot pieces of carpet?</p>

<p>A: That’s my dad, no? And we need the smaller pieces to finish the small room, right? So, we will do it really quick, after we go take a break and talk about it for a while. Then we will look in all your closets.</p>

<p>Q: So, do you think you would be able to, oh, I don’t know, put my phone jack back on the wall, so that I can connect to the internet <a href="#footnote_2_61" title="DSL uses phone lines. CANS don’t do dial-up">3</a> anytime soon, considering that the jack is four feet above the ground in a room you’ve <em>already finished</em>?</p>

<p>A: Oh, see, we need to keep it off, and it’s not in our contract to put things like doors or phone jacks back. But I have a brother-in-law who owns a company that does that sort of thing. I can give you his number.</p>

<p>Q: When will you be finished, and how did you break my Logitech keyboard, which was in a drawer in the garage, where we don’t even have carpet going in? Do you know how much I hate this old white Apple keyboard?</p>

<p>A: We’re done, so will you please sign this invoice that’s for another house we’re doing in two days? We don’t like keeping our paperwork straight. I have a sister who works for Logitech-</p>

<p>Q: OUT! Get out!</p>

<p>Microsoft has launched the first wave of their <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/22/microsoft_offers_first_hints_at_anti_apple_marketing_blitz_for_vista.html">$300 million advertising campaign</a> set to counter the “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” ads in an unlikely form.</p>

<p>“How’s that game playing going, Mac freaks?” asks <a href="http://www.se51.net/devnull/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/steve_ballmer2.jpg">Steve Ballmer</a> in a form letter sent to every “@apple.com” email address. “Oh, and <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>? Your Open Source software sucks! I mean, check out <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.Net</a>! That’s some Open Source software worth using, lemme tell ya!”</p>

<p>Needless to say, this quixotic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Rose">Tokyo Rose</a> style spam attack was devastating to the morale of Apple employees. “Ooooh, Stevie, them’s fightin’ words,” said Jonathan Ive, SVP of Industrial Design at Apple. “I mean, picking on our <em>open source development</em>? Wow, that’s hitting us where it hurts, pal. What’s next, a criticism of our favorite brand of floor wax? Please, not that!”</p>

<p>Peter Oppenheimer asked, “How much of your $300 million did you spend on writing this email?” Reports that Steve Jobs had to physically restrain <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> and Steve Wozniack<a href="#footnote_0_46" title="neither of whom work at Apple but both of whom have @apple.com email addresses due to tremendous whining">1</a> from “hopping on their Segways and giving Ballmer a piece of their mind” are as yet unverified.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs’ response was typically refined. In an email response he writes: “Wow, Ballmer. That’s quite some attack, and it hurts. It hurts almost as much as our 30% profit increase this quarter. I guess the “wow” really does “start now”, only a year after you launched Vista. Wow, indeed.”</p>

<p>For once, it was Microsoft who had no comment, except to remind us that they could “(expletive deleted) crush” the Crazy Apple News Site, which is entirely true.</p>

<p>In an unrelated side note, we here at CANS have just uninstalled Vista from Boot Camp on our iMac and installed XP instead.  It is surprisingly more stable.</p>
