<p>We’re not sure how this happened, but a courier today mis-delivered a sackful of letters addressed to</p>

<blockquote><p>Santa Jobs<br/>
1 Holiday Loop<br/>
Cupertino, North Pole<br/>
10101</p></blockquote>

<p>And it looks like our time practicing Steve Job’s signature paid off! In the spirit of all that is best in journalism, we thought we’d share a few of the letters with you.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Santa Jobs,</p>

<p>This year I want to be right about things some more. If you could kinda keep an eye on my blog and make things the way I write about them I will feel like a good person instead of a hollow, bitter shell.</p>

<p>Also, I want a pony.</p>

<p>Love,<br/>
Johnny Gruber</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Santa Jobs,</p>

<p>I just wanted to thank you for the present you gave me last year. Those six dozen factual tips (indexed as they were with the months in which they should be published) really helped us cement a lead over AppleInsider.com!</p>

<p>Oh, and speaking of “tips”, please find enclosed a check for one hundred thousand “CEO Salaries”, if you know what I’m sayin’. If this year’s gift is as good as last year’s, you can expect another tip.</p>

<p>Pleasure doin’ business with you,<br/>

Davie Pogue</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Santa Jobs,</p>

<p>I want people to like me. Or at least stop making fun of me for that <a href="http://natedickson.posterous.com/this-ladies-and-gentlemen-is-the-ceo-of-micro">picture in the Times</a>.</p>

<p>And a big pony.<br/>
Stevie Ballmer</p>

<hr />

<p>Wha? Whazzat? Huh? Oh. Oh. Okay, okay.</p>

<p>I wan’… I wan’…. I WAN’ THE ENTITY BACK! WHER’ THE CRAP DID ‘E GO?</p>

<p>Awwwwww….wha’ever man. Jus’ give me somma that whiskey.</p>

<p>An’ sombody make Gruber shut up ’bout that pony.</p>

<p>Jonny Maltz Moltz</p>

<hr />

<p>Look, Steve. Oh, all right, “Santa Jobs”</p>

<p>I don’t know why you do this every year. It’s so… well, actually it’s just like you, but whatever.</p>

<p>Look, you have to get me back on “Dancing with the Stars”, alright? I was robbed last time. I was freakin’ awesome, but the judges couldn’t handle me. You own that network, right? So just pull some strings, maybe fire a few people. You’ve always liked firing people, right? Anyway, do what you gotta do, but get me back on the air. I gotta wicked need to dance, baby!</p>

<p>Oh, hey, also, could you get me some new tires for my Segway? It eats less than a pony, which is nice.</p>

<p>Woz</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Santa Jobs,</p>

<p>I would like peace on earth. But I can’t do anything about it myself, because I’m too busy waiting for the world to change. So if you could do that I would love it. Also, please put a hit out on Jack Johnson, Norah Jones, and pretty much anyone else who’s played at a MacWorld or WWDC keynote other than me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Johnny Mayer</p>

<hr />

<p>Feel free to write your own letter to Santa Jobs in the comments. It’ll be at least as effective as these letters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we’re departing from our usual fare and offering you some tips for using the month of December to your advantage as a Mac user.</p>

<p>Q: So, this is what the top of a shark looks like…</p>

<p>A: Quiet, you.</p>

<p>Q: All right, I’ll bite<a href="#footnote_0_615" title="get it? Shark? Bite?  Get it?">1</a> –</p>

<p>A: Hey! Only I get to write footnotes!</p>

<p>Q: –Ignoring that… Okay, so, what sage advice do you offer as proof that you aren’t just wasting time and space with this article?</p>

<p>A: There are many unique opportunities in December for Mac Users! Lots of App bundles come up about this time every year, and there’s the sales on hardware, and hard drives, and hard games…</p>

<p>Q: So, you want us Mac users to take full advantage of…low low prices all across the internet?</p>

<p>A: Well, it’s also a time for bragging. I mean, let’s say you’ve got a family member who sends out a holiday dvd full of pictures of their kids in various activities all year, and then expects a nice, complimentary email praising their skill and my how little Jennifer has grown, hasn’t she? Well, as a Mac user, you can totally show them up by using iMovie to make your own holiday video, then host it on Mobile me, along with all your pictures and a thoughtfully-written blog. Then you can send a beautifully-themed email from Mail using one of Apple’s “stationary” options letting everyone know that your magnum opus is online, and they may view it at their convenience.</p>

<p>Q: So, we should take advantage of low, low prices AND use our Macs to make ourselves appear far superior to our PC-using relatives?</p>

<p>A: Well, yeah. I mean, isn’t that pretty much why you bought a Mac in the first place?</p>

<p>Q: Granted, but it doesn’t seem like that should have to wait until December.</p>

<p>A: It’s true. You should carry the spirit of Mac Superiority with you all the year round!</p>

<p>Q: I will! I will remember to use Mail and iMovie to look better than others! I will buy Apple’s OS upgrades and their new versions of iWork and iLife! I will keep the spirit of Mac Superiority in my heart, all the year!</p>

<p>A: Steve Jobs bless us, every one!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>This Friday we return from our month-long retreat to Camp NaNoWriMo to answer some inFrequently Answered Questions, like we used to. Like a family.</p>

<p>Today on a very special episode of Friday iFAQ we tackle a sensitive subject: Windows 7 and Boot Camp.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: some content may not be suitable for rabid Apple fans. Reader discretion is advised. <a href="#footnote_0_609" title="that’s two posts in a row with disclaimers. I don’t know. Maybe it’s me.">1</a></p>

<p>Q: So I have a question about Windows 7. Why does it suck so bad compared to OSX? Looks like MUCKrosoft has three more versions to go before they get it right, eh? Eh? Am I right?</p>

<p>A: It certainly is a Microsoft product, yes.</p>

<p>Q: And what’s with the Microsoft counting system? 95, 98, Me, XP, Vista, 7? What’s that all about? I tell ya, their marketing department is almost as bad as their dev team! Awww yeah, they felt that one! ZING! Eh? Eh? Amiright? Awww yeah.</p>

<p>A: They have certainly had some difficulty finding and adhering to a naming system, heheh.</p>

<p>Q: Say, what’s the matter? We’re talking about Windows here. Why are you just sitting there? Where’s the fire, the pizazz? What’s wrong?</p>

<p>A: Oh it’s nothing. It’s fine. Say, that Steve Ballmer, what’s that all about?</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, look that’s great, but we can bash on Ballmer any time. But now it’s time to rip the new Windows a new one! Come on, let loose!</p>

<p>A: Okay, okay, here goes: ahem. No, not that. Okay, one more shot. Here goes: Wow, Windows still doesn’t have a built-in email client capable of connecting to Exchange Servers? What’s up with that?</p>

<p>Q: … I’m disappointed, I really am. I expected so much more from you. What are the children going to think, if they see you like this? It’s sad, so sad.</p>

<p>A: Look, it’s not a big deal. Macs still totally rock.</p>

<p>Q: So what is it then? I mean it’s not like you’ve started liking…. oh, oh no no no. That’s it, isn’t it? You, you don’t LIKE Windows 7, do you?</p>

<p>A: Look, it’s not a big deal–</p>

<p>Q: Bu- Wha- Why? How? How did this happen? What does this mean for us? For the site?</p>

<p>A: Look, I had to work with Windows 7 on a few projects in my grad school class this semester, and we just kinda, got along.</p>

<p>Q: Got along? With Windows? Why? What did OSX do wrong?</p>

<p>A: Nothing! OSX is still the number one OS in my life, and nothing will change that.</p>

<p>Q: Do the devices know?</p>

<p>A: Um, yeah. I’ve been dual-booting my MacBook Pro–</p>

<p>Q: Oh that’s just wrong–</p>

<p>A: And the iMac has been running Windows as well.</p>

<p>Q: And the iPod Touch? Have you dragged little Touch into your sick new world?</p>

<p>A: What? No! The Touch still syncs with my home iMac.</p>

<p>Q: Well, it’s good to see you’ve retained some sense of propriety.  But, still, saying that you like Windows 7? That’s just wrong. It’s like the world has just pulled out from under my feet… I gotta sit down.<br/>
<em>[Sits down]</em><br/>
Well, anyway, the semester is over, so you can un-partition your drives and we can put this whole thing behind us, right?</p>

<p>A: Well…</p>

<p>Q: Oh, I do not like the sound of that…</p>

<p>A: It’s just that, well, I’ve only just started grad school, and there’s a lot of classes ahead of me that will be using Windows, so I’ll need to keep dual booting for a while…</p>

<p>Q: And that’s it? You’re just going over to 7 just like that? How did Windows get you under its spell? What is it about Windows that you like? Is it that new interface? It is, isn’t it? Prancing around all tarted up like some cheap French–</p>

<p>A: Now, you know OSX’s interface has always been enough for me! OSX is sleek, and stylish, Like Audrey Hepburn.</p>

<p>Q: And Windows 7 is painted and dolled up like Paris Hilton. Real operating systems are secure enough in themselves to not need all those alpha effects and glowing start buttons. But if what you are saying is true, and it’s not the slapped-on-with-a-trowel interface special effects, what is it? How did Windows steal your heart?</p>

<p>A: I told you, I’m still loyal to OSX. But, well, I’ll be working a lot with Windows in school and in my new job, so I want you to try to be nice and get along.</p>

<p>Q: Oh, so it’s a new job too, now? What about a new computer or two to go with your fancy new schooling and employment? Maybe a few Dells around the place–</p>

<p>A: Stop that!</p>

<p>Q: Perhaps an HP or two in the den, one for work, one for play, right?</p>

<p>A: Knock it off! There won’t be any Dells or HPs coming into the house. This is an all-Apple house and it’s going to stay that way. All I said is that Windows 7 isn’t that terrible. Sometimes a programmer needs to write some C#, and when that need arises Windows is there for me. And it’s important to me that you can accept that. MacBook Pro has accepted it, and so has iMac. What about you, Q? Can you accept that sometimes I’ll have to spend some time with Windows? Just for work purposes?</p>

<p>Q: Just for work? Promise?</p>

<p>A: I promise.</p>

<p>Q: Well… I guess I can accept that. But I don’t have to like it.</p>

<p>A: Deal.</p>

<p><em>[Cut to a interior shot of a kitchen. A celebrity<a href="#footnote_1_609" title="I'm thinking Jerry Seinfeld, as punishment for those terrible Vista commercials">2</a> who needs to work off some community service time is seated at the table]</em></p>

<p>Parents, talk to your kids about dual booting before someone else does. Let them know the risks involved, and help them understand that healthy dual booting is done in moderation. Boot Camp doesn’t have to ruin your life. And remember, whenever you boot into Windows, use up-to-date anti-virus software. Thank you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/144929/2009/12/apple_printers.html?lsrc=rss_main">Macworld’s Coverage</a> of Apple’s tragic shift away from printers has led us to do similar research into other products Apple will never make again. <strong>Warning</strong>! This article may prove painful for people with strong, irrational personal connections to some of these products.</p>

<h3>The Newton</h3>

<p>Yes, it’s sad, but the Newton has gone, and will not return. Yes, there are people who say that the iPod Touch is the Newton for the 21st century, but those people are mentally ill and you should stop talking to them. That’s like saying that a MacBook Pro is the Babbage Analytical Engine for the 21st century. They are vaguely similar, but <em>not</em> similar enough for me to <em>not</em> want to hit you repeatedly for saying it. Apple stopped making the Newton because it was a stupid product and you should be ashamed for bringing it up in polite company. It’s like telling the story of how your dog got hit by a car in the middle of a business dinner with clients from many nations. Why was your dog even <em>at</em> a business dinner with clients from many nations? And how did the car get in the restaurant? Why haven’t you told me this story yet? It sounds fascinating.</p>

<h3>HyperCard</h3>

<p>HyperCard is also dead. No, <a href="http://www.runrev.com">Revolution</a> is not the new Hypercard, Revoution is a bunch of Irish people trying to make money by selling an increasingly bloated scripting environment.  No, AppleScript is not revolution, AppleScript is more like Perl done strange.  You are a sad, strange person for still wanting your OS7-style scripted PowerPoint, and you need to get out into the fresh air a little bit more.  I should also get out into the fresh air a little more, but it’s like 4 degrees outside right now, and better you than me in that kind of weather.</p>

<h3>Snood</h3>

<p>Okay, I admit, you can still buy <a href="http://www.snood.com/">snood</a>, but I really don’t know why you would. Is there some kind of strange mind-control subliminal messaging in that game? Why do people still play it? It’s kinda ugly and not really all that much fun. So, it should be dead, even if it isn’t.</p>

<p>Well, I admit that this wasn’t the most useful post on earth, and definitely didn’t make me any new friends.  But I also contend that it was at least as topical and sensible as Macworld’s <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/144736/2009/12/appleprinters.html">three</a> <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/144880/2009/12/five_important_printers.html">part</a> <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/144929/2009/12/apple_printers.html">series</a> on printers that haven’t been made for a decade or more.  Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Week one got off to a good start when I was able to clear my school schedule all the way until November 12 by the simple expedient of doing my homework early. Things got a little rougher later on in the week, however, when everyone in my house got very sick. Twice.  Then there was a football game at which I had to work.  And today, MacHeist announced a free bundle.  So that’s awesome. Go check out the six free products, and give me a suggestion about which one I should write about in the first week of December.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we cover the one and only <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>, for all your storing-secret-stuff needs!</p>

<p>A: What’s the big deal? I already use one password!</p>

<p>Q: The program “1Password”?</p>

<p>A: No, I mean I have one password that I use for everything everywhere. Wanna know what it is?</p>

<p>Q: NO! That’s just stupid! Why even ask?</p>

<p>A: It’s “kittenzcanhasfood”! It’s super secure because it’s long and has a “z” instead of an “s” in there!</p>

<p>Q: And it’s on the internet! That has “secure password” all over it!</p>

<p>A: Aaaah, what’s the big deal? So the five people who read this site will know my password, so what? I don’t even really exist.</p>

<p>Q: True, but if you did, suddenly all your everything would be vulerable to…let me see here… <em>anybody on earth</em>. If you want to be that exposed on the web why not just take the plunge and run Windows Vista? And it’s more like 20 people, thank you very much.</p>

<p>A: I still don’t see how a program is going to help me be “safer” on the web. I mean, I still just have one password, it just stores it a bunch of times.</p>

<p>Q: Or you can let it create new passwords for you, which are random and secure, and let it fill those in for you.</p>

<p>A: So anyone can walk up to my computer and use all my stored 1Password passwords. Great. MUCH better than what I’m doing now.</p>

<p>Q: No, they would have to know your “1Password” that you use to sign in to 1Password, otherwise it won’t fill in squat.</p>

<p>A: Okay, so it fills in passwords on one computer…</p>

<p>Q: All your Macs…</p>

<p>A: What now?</p>

<p>Q: 1Password can synchronize your stored passwords to all your macs. And your stored software serial numbers. And your stored…whatever. It specializes in those areas, though. Oh, and it can sync with your iPhone/iPod Touch.</p>

<p>A: Well that’s just spiffy. So what can’t it do?</p>

<p>Q: Make this post funny.</p>

<p>An unseen roadblock has arisen in the adoption of Apple’s latest hardware offering.<br/>
“Magic? Pfaugh!” said Nigel Rutheford, a bland, portly tax adjuster from Norwich. “When you get older, my boy, you’ll realize there’s no such thing. I won’t have this kind of nonsense brought into my home!” He shook his huge florid face to emphasize this last point, then sent his young charge to his room.</p>

<p>“I wish my uncle could see that ‘bluetooth connectivity’ is technological, not mythological,” simpered “Perry H.”, Rutheford’s orphaned nephew. “And I really should have known better than to tell him about the new ‘gestures’ feature. And I really really shouldn’t have mentioned the ‘two-finger gesture’ first.”</p>

<p>“This problem seems to be an epidemic amongst a certain breed of cardigan-wearing Britons with large-haired wives, ” said Eve Bite, Apple’s Product Adoption Liason in the UK. “For some reason the very word ‘magic’ makes them go all irrational and 1950′s-ish. They seem to feel that ‘magic’ leads to talking animals, flying confections, and socially embarrasing hijinks. Naturally, this isn’t the image we want associated with Apple’s products.”</p>

<p>Nobody at Apple’s Cupertino offices was available for comment, although we’re pretty sure we caught a glimpse of Steve Jobs hurredly doffing a flowing purple robe with mystical symbols.</p>

<p>So, we noticed today that 1.) we didn’t write anything on Friday and 2.) what we wrote two weeks ago is no longer true. We said that <a href="http://www.typestyler.com/">TypeStylerX’s webpage</a> had buttons that looked like this:</p>

<p>[![Ultra-Classy Button][3]][3]
Ultra-Classy Button</p>

<p>And we mocked them for this, considering the nature of the product.  We are pleased to see that the buttons on the site now look like this:</p>

<p><a href="#footnote_0_582" title="There’s always a “But…”"><img src="#footnote_0_582" title="There’s always a “But…”" alt="Ever So Much Better!" /></a>
Ever So Much Better!</p>

<p>Which is a change for the much, much better.</p>

<p>But…<a href="#footnote_0_582" title="There’s always a “But…”">1</a></p>

<p>There’s still so much more to do for the site.  And here’s where I’m on thin ice. First of all, props to Strider software for getting a new version out after 7 years. Props for hanging on for 7 years, and for that matter, having a commercial product on the market at all.  I’ve got any number of half-finished<a href="#footnote_1_582" title="and in some cases, half-started">2</a> programs that haven’t yet seen the light of day, and may not ever do so.  So with all that, they still got a web store up and functional, no mean feat in and of itself. Heaven knows that I don’t spend a whole lot of time on site design on this site.  I choose a WordPress theme, make a few changes, and run with it. So me criticizing someone else’s site design can be compared to a telephone conversation between a pot and a kettle regarding scorch marks.  But when layout matters, like when I’m making a site for a client, then I focus on every pixel on every browser, and spend almost as much time on the layout as the code.</p>

<p>But…<a href="#footnote_2_582" title="Sometimes there’s two “But…”s">3</a></p>

<p>This site has nothing to do with text layout, graphic design, or the like. I’m here to make fun of people in hopefully creative and theoretically amusing ways.  My site design is not integral to my message. If you are selling a product that is meant to make things look good, yours is.  Really, if you are selling a product <em>full stop</em>, your site design is integral to your message.  <a href="http://pagehand.com/">Pagehand</a>‘s developer knows this, as does the gentleman who makes <a href="http://literatureandlatte.com">Scrivener</a>. They have both designed beautiful sites that tell you exactly what the product does, with screenshots, trials, pricing and everything else easy to find and attractively designed. And their headers don’t look like they were made in 2001.</p>

<p>Well, you could say that this article is 1.) needlessly long, boring and preachy, 2.) more appropriate for <a href="http://coals2newcastle.com">my other site</a>, or even 3.) more appropriate for throwing away entirely.  But hopefully someone at Strider Software will look into hiring a web designer to update their site<a href="#footnote_3_582" title="I charge a very reasonable $35/hour. But something tells me that this post is not the place to advertise that fact.">4</a> . Or at least replace the header image and add a few screen shots.</p>

<p>Okay, I’m done. Theoretically funny posts return soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/10/19results.html">Apple Reported Fourth Quarter Results</a> yesterday, leaving reporters scrambling for good ways to express their financial situation to laymen.</p>

<p>“Seriously, they have a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/buttload">buttload</a> of cash right now,” one analyst put it.  He then spent the next two hours trying to convince his editor that a “butt” is a large container used “back in the day”.</p>

<p>Peter Oppenheimer was typically restrained during the official conference call, stating that the company is “delighted with our September quarter and fiscal 2009 results.” Unbeknownst to people listening to the call, he was doing what Jony Ive later described as “an unholy melding of the Cabbage Patch and the Macarena” at the time he said this, while Steve Jobs was “joyfully firing interns”.</p>

<p>Out of a cannon.</p>

<p>“We can afford it,” was all he said.</p>

<p>The interns were unavailable for comment.  Unless “UUUuuuuUUUrrgh. My head!” counts as a comment.</p>
