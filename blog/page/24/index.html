<p>Apple has admitted that millions upon millions of viruses are targeted at the Mac operating system, and that every Mac, from the humblest Mini to the greatest Mac Pro to the lightest MacBook Air will soon be a drooling mass of spambots and DDoS attacker clones.</p>

<p>Well, actually they <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2550">encouraged</a> “the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent, thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult.”</p>

<p>But this minor distinction should not stop us from engaging in large-scale, wholesale panic.  It’s the end of an era, people, and viruses or not, we are going to start getting snobby comments from long-standing (long-suffering?) Windows users.  Again. And more this time.</p>

<p>“Yeah, how do you like that, hippies?” said Rob Enderle, apparently channeling the spirit of Richard Nixon.  “The shoe’s on the other foot now, isn’t it?  Your precious Steve Jobs didn’t save you from the virii in the world, because he can’t!  We’ll get you yet!  You won’t have Rob Enderle to kick around any more!”<a href="#footnote_0_228" title="This rant funded by the Symantec Corporation">1</a> While syntactically null, this statement goes to further demonstrate the inherent instability of a personality that would deliberately use the word “virii”.</p>

<p>Enderle to one side, now it’s time to start doing pathological system checks, study each and every file in your “Systems” folder, and send emails frothing with exclamation points warning users not to click on icons that look like teddy bears.  Just like the old days, when we used Windows 98.  Remember those days?  Weren’t they great?</p>

<p>Now, I know there are naysayers out there that claim that, with a negligible number of actual live exploits and a better-than-average schedule of system updates and security patches, coupled with a solid Unix foundation, the Mac is not exactly the virus hotel that Windows has become.  But this is just the kind of self-satisfied hubris that is likely to bring the Mac community crashing to the ground in a matter of days as the Mac Apocalypse strikes.  On December 7.  At 7:07 PM.   Which it will do without warning.</p>

<p>Thus far, the news of the Mac Apocalypse has not been widely heeded, and despite Apple’s empassioned pleas for all users to try and thwart this wave of nightmarish evil with the sacrifice of just a few thousand clock cycles per second,<a href="#footnote_1_228" title="their exact words are, “Here are some available antivirus utilities:”">2</a> most people say that they “wouldn’t install an anti-virus program on their Mac even if it also played <a href="http://www.womgames.com/index.php">Snood</a> and any two Pangea games of your choice.” <a href="#footnote_2_228" title="What is this obsession with Snood, anyway?  It’s really not a very good game at all.  But every Mac user I know who got on the Mac train before Tiger seems to play it.">3</a> Well fine.  That’s your choice.  Just don’t come cryin’ to us when you get p0wned by some 13-year-old Somali computer pirate.  Because we won’t be able to read your emails.  We’re not installing AV software either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>You know how, when they release movie trailers, sometimes they put all the best parts of the movie into the trailer?  This isn’t one of those kinds.  This is a scene that wasn’t working out at all, draft after draft, and  I needed to move on.  The version you see here is nothing like what will be in the novel, but I had fun writing it and thought you might enjoy it.</p>

<p>Oh, and “Guard” and “Big Mama” <em>are</em> their names.  The main character is Jason. This starts out from his point of view, and switches to Guard a little way in.</p>

<h2 id="guards-story-act-iii">Guard’s Story: Act III</h2>

<p>Guard was already seated when I got there, so I sat down facing him,  and noticed how little it hurt to do things like sit down and move around these days.  I was almost whole again!  But now was not the time to worry about my side.  Guard was going to tell me what had happened next, and I was more than ready to find out.<br />
He waited until I was comfortably seated, then began.</p>

<p>I was not popular around the village after that. (Guard said.)  The raid had been particularly savage, and the raiders had made it known that they were after me and my new little ideas.  Many accused me of wasting time talking when I could have spent that time breaking more of our attackers’ faces.  Many accused me of inviting their wrath in my pride, and my bad attitude.  I said that they were welcome to do what they thought best, and that all I had ever done was work for the good of the village, but nobody wanted to hear that again.<br />
I really didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t want to go back to raiding, because I couldn’t see how it was right to take from others what we could get for ourselves.  I didn’t want to give up my studies for war training.<br />
I wasn’t getting anywhere, and I knew that I wouldn’t, so long as I was trying to figure things out on my own.  I knew someone who could help, but I really, really didn’t want to go to her for help.  Still, I had no other option.  I went and found the fat bossy lady from the other village.<br />
She was sitting outside her house, looking pleased with herself as usual, and not doing a whole lot.  When she saw me coming she nodded, then waited for me to take a seat before talking.<br />
“So, people aren’t as easy to please as you thought. And sometimes you need to hit someone a little bit. The question is; what are you going to do about it?  How do you propose to handle your little problem?”<br />
“I don’t know.”<br />
“What did I tell you last time?”<br />
“Something about pure force.  What happened to intelligence?”<br />
“You need to know where to push, sure, but some things won’t go away by talking.  Sometimes you need to act. Sometimes what you do won’t work, but at least you will have tried.”<br />
“This part of the story isn’t very easy to write, is it?”<br />
“No, son, this part is getting pretty sticky and hard to get moving on at all.”<br />
I looked at her for a second. Things weren’t going the way we expected.<br />
“What should we do to make things work better?”<br />
“Well, the Author’s had a hard enough time; why don’t we skip ahead to the real point of this scene, and go from there? And on the way, we’ll summarize what we are supposed to say in this section!”<br />
I liked the way she was thinking.  It would get us out of a terribly slow and convoluted part of the story.  We started walking through the plot, ignoring narrative theory, and talking over what we should have been doing.<br />
“So, Guard, here’s the part where you try to turn away from your true path, once again.”<br />
“Yep. Here’s where you remind me of what I’m meant to be, and what I can do to really make myself what I’m supposed to be.  I mean, you know, where you tell me about protecting those who need it, moving against the evils that beset us all, and what I can do to use my brain to carefully and properly direct my force.”<br />
“Oogh, I forgot about this part.  Why did you fight me so hard, anyway?”<br />
I grinned a little, something I wouldn’t do in story.  “I didn’t want to believe that my whole purpose in life is to hit people.”<br />
“Well, you’ve learned better by the time the story picks up, right?”<br />
“Well, I’m still brooding, you see.  I’m angry, frustrated, and I want to know that I can do more.  I mean, look at this fight scene.  I don’t even remember it; because I’m berserk in that scene.” I watched for a moment. “I got some good hits in though, didn’t I?”<br />
“That’s my Guard!” Big Mama laughed.  “Oh, be careful, you almost tripped over the burning building, where you weren’t able to save the crops.”<br />
“I sure did.  That scene is some pretty rough ground. It could use some work before it’s really ready to be in any book.  I mean, burning crops? What is the Author thinking?”<br />
“Well, as long as it makes the end symbolic, that’s fine.” She responded warmly, mostly so you could remember who was saying what.<br />
“Okay, so, here we are at the beach where you decide to come with me, be my bodyguard, and learn the true and right uses of who you are and what you do. Are you ready to get back into the story line?” She asked.  I sighed.<br />
“Okay. I don’t like this scene, but the Author just marked this whole section as a “crappy draft”, so we can at least rest in the knowledge that it’ll be changed before too long.”<br />
“Thank goodness. Okay, places everyone!” Big Mama said, then we stepped back into the story line.  It tingled.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>*</strong></td>
      <td>**</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>“So, kid, what’s it gonna be? You gonna stay on this island and hate yourself for fighting off attackers, or are you gonna come with me and learn how to do what needs done when it needs done?”</p>

<p>“Do I have a choice?”“Of course.  You always have a choice.  You can be a nobody or you can be your best self. It’s up to you. It always has been.”I sighed.  She was right.  I knew there was more for me out there with her than there was here, fighting people I didn’t want to fight for causes I didn’t believe in.  I stepped onto the ship, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Ta-daaa!  I should be done in time, without even stretching too much. Oh, and the fourth wall stays completely intact in the real novel, don’t worry.  No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie's_World">post-modernism</a> here! Thanks again for your support!</p>

<p>While I was writing my little book I came across this site that makes a pretty cloud out of the words or RSS feeds you give it. So I fed it this site and this is what I got back…er, It’s a java thing, so I’m not going to embed it.  <a href="http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/334259/Crazy_Apple_Words">But here’s the link. </a></p>

<p>Book is going well, I should finish well before the end of the month. I’m talking, I’ll have hours to spare. Thank you both (okay, thanks to all the lurkers as well) for your patience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>So, the basic plot for this novel is one that has been bouncing around in my skull for, oh, about ten years now.  I’ve always had a pretty good idea who the main cast would be, what they would be like, and how the plot would go.  On November 1st I sat down to finally write this novel that I’d been ruminating over, and figured that it was all going to go just like I’d planned it for the last decade.</p>

<p>In the second chapter I introduced a few extra characters to fill out a dinner party scene.  One of them said his bit, bowed, walked off stage and we’ve never heard from him again, as is good and proper.  One of the other ones,  however, attached himself to my protagonist and rapidly became his best friend.</p>

<p>At first I smiled at this little slice of life, but as it became clearer and clearer that this interloper wasn’t planning on going anywhere I started to look for ways to gently get him out of the story.  The problem was that he and my protagonist were now fast friends, and what’s worse, this new guy was actually pretty well developed and fit into the story like a gear in a Swiss clock.  Trying to pull him out would bring the whole thing down on my head.</p>

<p>A few chapters later the new guy gave us his life story and to my astonishment it was better than some of the life stories I had been working on for years.  My attitude to this little me-tooer switched from a slight desire to chase him off to a more appeasing stance, making sure he was comfortable, got enough face time, because he’s made the whole story work better and has just quietly suggested ways in which he can be helpful in wrapping up all the loose ends.</p>

<p>So, the  moral of the story is: Don’t belive you are in control of fiction during a first draft. You can be in control during the later drafts.</p>

<p>The good news is that I’ve written over 32,000 words out of 50,000, which means I should be done with the NaNoWriMo challenge a bit earlier than the end of November and can probably get a few words about this whole Papermaster thing up before it blows over.  Is it just me, or does Papermaster sound like a terrible hybrid Print Shop/Filemaker program?  Everytime I see his name on news sites I wonder how he got it.  I can only think it was a joke at Ellis Island some years ago.</p>

<p>Anyway, be good, have fun, I’ll be back with some Not-Entirely-Sane Apple News soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>October 30: I shanghaied a good friend of mine into writing a novel this month as well.  My method was roughly as follows:</p>

<p>“C’mon! Write a book. You’d write a good book! You should write a book!”</p>

<p>Eventually he agreed. I’m sure his book will be better than mine.  That accomplished, I next set out to perform the most perilous part of writing a novel: choosing a novel writing program.  This is no small feat.<a href="#footnote_0_215" title="Size 11… oh right, feat, not feet.  Sorry">1</a>  There are so many good choices, like StoryMill, Scrivener, Pages, Mellel, WriteRoom, most of which I er, already owned.  So I decided to go with Scrivener, based on its amazing flexibility, stability, ease of use, and  the fact that I would then have an excuse to purchase a license.  So far I have been glad about that choice.</p>

<p>October 31: Fear set in: What if I lose my novel to a random and spontaneous hard drive failure?  I spent four hours setting up an SVN repository and making sure that I have copies of my novel on all three macs, my iDisk, and of course checked into SVN.  There. My ideas are safe.  Now I just need to actually have some ideas.</p>

<p>November 1, 1:27 AM: Gripped by insomnia, I get up and write around 500 words.  Later that morning I go back and change all of them.  “Don’t write under the influence of insomnia” becomes my new motto.</p>

<p>November 2: I start to get really sick, and notice that I may not be doing well when writing about my main character undergoing surgery nearly makes me lose my breakfast.  I lie down on the couch and write the next few pages on my laptop.</p>

<p>November 3: I am unable to go to work because of the Martian Death Flu that I have contracted.  I write about 2000 words on the third, most of them pretty good.  I eat roughly two bites of food this entire day.</p>

<p>November 4: Home sick again.  Worried about dehydration (one of the characters in my book suffers from it) I send my wife out for “eleven million bottles of Power Aid”  She returns with two, which is more than sufficient. Thus re-hydrated, I go back to writing.</p>

<p>November 5: I go back to work. My writing suffers, as I am still somewhat sick and not all that able to keep code and novel straight in my brain this day.  My comments in the code I’m writing start shaping up into a pretty interesting story featuring a guy named API and his girlfriend, Ruby.</p>

<p>November 6: Due to a sporting event at the university where I work I am unable to write more than about 20 words this day.  Not that I cared all that much about the sporting event; but I was required to do tech support during the event, and a crowded football stadium is not the best venue for writing about Americans recuperating in the Philippines. Fortunately, I have the next five days off of work.</p>

<p>November 7: I am back on track, novel-wise.  I have a pretty good writing day, and also buy a Coldplay album, a Jack Johnson Album, and an EP by The Flaming Lips.  Two of the three are good music for writing.  Guess which one isn’t.</p>

<p>November 8: I write the day’s 1667 words and realize I’m still about 3000 words below my goal for this point in the month.  I sit back down, and with Jack Johnson blasting through my headphones, fall asleep on the desk.  I wake up, switch albums, and get back to work.  By evenfall I’ve closed the gap to 1500 words, which I should be able to make up in the next few days.</p>

<p>So that’s where we stand.  There are all sorts of interesting things going on the world, and if I get caught up with the novel I plan to write about a few of them, like the AT&amp;T dude’s predicitons about what iPhone 3.0 will be able to do for you.((“It’ll start your car. It’ll do your taxes! It’ll translate conversations you’re having with Japanese people on the fly, provided you don’t mind saying things like, “I would like to super-fun the racoons twice mostly” when you meant, “I’ll fax the contract this afternoon.”))  Thanks again for your patience!</p>

 [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikimania_stallman_keynote2.jpg</p>

<p>Q: Why does AbiWord look like crap?</p>

<p>A: I blame Raymond.  He keeps pushing that “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yGFNKDloXq0C&amp;dq=cathedral bazaar&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=uzuehy-UNs&amp;source=bn&amp;sig=delBtc8a0qygBDBdPeZXPI9K3eU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result">bazaar</a>” garbage, when some of us are trying to build cathedrals for everyone to worship in. And AbiWord is as Bizarre as they come.</p>

<p>Q: So open source should be tightly controlled open source?</p>

<p>A: All source should be in the hands of the FSF, so that we can give the people what they need, and they give us all they can.</p>

<p>And then I’ll eat their delicious, succulent brains.</p>

<p>Q: What was that last part?</p>

<p>A: Nothing!  Seriously, the problem isn’t control, it’s patents.  If I had all the control back when I was alive I wouldn’t be stalking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> right now to convince him to join me on the other side.  Perl would have been an FSF project and I could have told him how to get version 6 done in less than 10 years.</p>

<p>Q: How’s <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">Hurd</a> coming along, by the way?</p>

<p>A: That’s GNU/Hurd, and it’ll be done any time now.</p>

<p>Q: Huh. So, back to AbiWord…</p>

<p>A: No, look, you mac people act like you’re all friendly to open source with your MacPorts, and your built-in ruby and python and stuff, but really all you want to do is look down your noses at those of us who want to live completely free of patents.</p>

<p>Q: Is “live” really the right word for you to use, all things considered?  And I thought you’d softened towards us.</p>

<p>A: It’s the iPhone, man. Yes, it’s pretty. Yes, it “just works”. Yes, it’s on a large network that works everywhere and you can get a gazillion awesome apps and games and everything. But why you apple folk gotta keep dumpin’ on the G1?</p>

<p>Q: Oh, did the bearded zombie get his feelings hurt?  Did some bad commenters say mean things about your phone on a naughty ol’ forum somewhere?</p>

<p>A: <strong>sniff</strong>. I mean, you’ve won, okay? Can’t you just leave us second-placers alone? You think we don’t know there’s problems? You’d think a forum like “iPhone Friends” would  be more friendly!</p>

<p>Q: Well, you gotta consider the source, Richie. Mac people can be like that sometimes.  You can’t let it get to you.  Your phone will grow up and be the pride of geeky nerds everywhere, just like Linux…</p>

<p>A: <em>GNU</em>/Linux…</p>

<p>Q: …Just like Linux has become.  And your open source revolution will continue in the glorious tradition of never making any real money.</p>

<p>A:  You…you think so?</p>

<p>Q: I know so.</p>

<p>A: Awww, thanks. You just made an old, crazy zombie’s day.</p>

<p>Can I eat your brain?</p>

<p>Q: No.</p>

<p>A: Just a nibble off the right frontal lobe?</p>

<p>Q:No.</p>

<p>A: C’mon! Gruber let me eat his!</p>

<p>Q: That explains a lot.  Look, if  you’re hungry, go chew on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boing_Boing">Doctrow</a>.</p>

<p>A: Ewww, I try to stay away from junk food.</p>

<p>Q: Look, can we just end this post?</p>

<p>A: All right. But brain jokes are so much fun!</p>

<p>Q: Fine. Go eat Merlin Mann’s brain. He’s been expanding it lately so there should be some scraps lying around.  He won’t miss ‘em.</p>

<p>A: Woo hoo!</p>

<p>Okay, this year I’m gonna do it.  I’ve talked about it for the last few years, acted like it was gonna happen, but this year I’m really gonna do it.  I’m gonna make it happen.  That’s right; this year I’m participating in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a><img src="#footnote_0_208" alt="1" title="If I was into special effects there would be, like, fireworks or something here." /></p>

<p>50,000 words, 30 days.  I got some characters. I got an idea for a story. I got the software, I got the drive, I got the ambition. Sure, it’ll be a sacrifice.  I won’t get to write long, loving posts about my G1 when it gets here on the 10th. I won’t get to start the tradition of letting the Ruby Ninja Androids write a post on the day after Thanksgiving.  But it won’t be that bad. After all, It’s only 1666.66 words per day, and this post is already up to, what… 190 words<a href="#footnote_1_208" title="I write posts non-sequentially. There were two sentences after this one when I wrote that.  I also added some stuff before it. Stop trying to figure out the numbers. Like counting John McCain’s houses: It’s just not possible.">2</a> I’m in trouble.</p>

<p>I’ll post things here until November 1st, to get in shape and give you something to look back on during November. I’ll write posts next month as well, but they’re gonna be more novel related than Mac news. So if you hate terrible amateur novels, please tune back in on December 1st.  I don’t blame you. For those brave souls who hang on, don your sailor’s caps, because it’s <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/429107">Terrible First-Draft Prose ahoy</a><img src="#footnote_2_208" alt="3" title="not that this is a major departure from my usual writing. It’s just less mac-themed" /></p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week: the Beauty from Britain: <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/">RapidWeaver</a>!</p>

<p>Q: Alas! I fear me that I hast not the knowledge requisite to avail myself of yon weaver’s rapidity!</p>

<p>A: Fear not, fair maid, but take heart, for I am here to instruct thee in the art of speedy creation of glorious tapestries of light. Disclose thy mind unto me that I may more readily put thee at thine ease.</p>

<p>Q: Nay, it is not seemly impose upon so great a scholar as thine illustrious self, whining and mewling like the discourteous cat, seeking a pittance from the tables of thy wisdom. Pray expunge from thy mind the very thought of my question and let it not prey upon thee more.</p>

<p>A: By’r lady, tis not so! Surely, the crown of wisdom is the sharing of’t, and he that learns but turns not again to teach is as the soughing wind in the marshes of the north, where the rude blast pummels and rattles the bony trees, but brings not the life-giving rains, nor cleans the sky of tattered clouds, that the sun may be felt again.</p>

<p>Q: Your words do shame me, Sir Wizard, and I see that I must also learn humility, and let not my noisome and petty pride stand in the way of proper instruction. to this end then, will I ask my questions, that in the answering you may more fulsomely burnish your knowledge even as I profit thereby.</p>

<p>A: Ask then, and what slender learning I have acquired from my slight studies shall be thine for the asking.</p>

<p>Q: This then, is my question: Whilst rapidly weaving a web page dedicated to the weaving of tapestries, I find that I have need of dynamic, ever-changing data, such as can only be provided by PHP. Though I have some slight skill in the creation of PHP classes and sites, I find that, upon uploading my creations to my server, they are marred and deformed by lewd </p>
