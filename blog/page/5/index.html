<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products. </p>

<p>This week we look at the newest player in the OS game: Chrome OS.</p>

<p>Q: Why do we need a new OS? Especially one that’s basically just a browser? </p>

<p>A: Heck, why not? I mean, Chrome’s a pretty sweet browser, right?</p>

<p>Q: Sure, but–</p>

<p>A: And you like having things boot up quickly, right?</p>

<p>Q: Well, who doesn’t? But that’s not the point–</p>

<p>A: Well then I fail to see what your problem is. Is it that you hate Christmas, Mr. Grinch?</p>

<p>Q: Ah, the sweet smell of seasonal <em>ad hominem</em> attacks. How about this, hot shot: What do you do with your beloved Chrome OS when you’re not in range of a wireless or Verizon cell tower?</p>

<p>A: Well, that’s what books are for.</p>

<p>Q: So the best thing to do in case of network outage is to run straight back to the arms of Johannes Gutenberg, then?</p>

<p>A: Well, you could use a Kindle…</p>

<p>Q: And that’s kind of my point. I could buy a MacBook Air–</p>

<p>A: I can’t. How much do they pay you?</p>

<p>Q: And when I didn’t have a wireless connection my MacBook Air would still be useful. A Chrome OS laptop would be a very sleek, instant-on paperweight.</p>

<p>A: Seriously, First you’re standing in line for an iPad, now you’re saying you can buy MacBook Airs all willy-nilly. I’m doing this for my slim cut of our slim advertising revenue.</p>

<p>Q: People come for the star power baby. But you haven’t answered my question. Why should I limit myself when I can get all of the Chrome <em>OS</em> functionality on any other computer by just installing the free Chrome <em>browser</em>?</p>

<p>A: Maybe you should just go buy an answer to your question, Mr. Trump. It’s more than my job’s worth to answer questions like that, mate.</p>

<p>Q: So yeah, there’s no good reason to buy a Chrome OS laptop.</p>

<p>A: Especially since Google’s almost inevitably going to merge Chrome OS with Android at some point.</p>

<p>Q: Aha! there is an answer.</p>

<p>A: Look, Google’s good at a lot of things, but being really firm and steadfast in one thing ain’t one of them. They like to play far too much to make it a good bet to get in on the ground floor of anything that requires you to put money on the table. Stick to GMail, Chrome the Browser, and regular ol’ google searches, and remember what happened to all those people who tried to make business cases around Google Wave. </p>

<p>Q: “All those people”?</p>

<p>A: Well, Gina Trapani wrote a <a href="http://completewaveguide.com/">book</a> about it.</p>

<p>Q: Yeah.</p>

<p>A: So, one thumb down<a href="#footnote_0_1016" title="if the letter A has a thumb">1</a> for Google Chrome the OS, one thumb up for the browser. Happy now?</p>

<p>Q: Very. Well, I’m off to go spend more money than you make in a year. Later!</p>

<p>A: Rrrrgh. It’s a consonant’s world, I tell you.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we help you help your eyes with the oddly-named <a href="http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/">F.lux</a> utility.</p>

<p>Q: Sometimes I stay up late, doing…things. Things that…hurt me.</p>

<p>A: What did the common Ellipsis ever do to you?</p>

<p>Q: I wake up, bleary-eyed and strained. I bump into walls in the dark. I feel like a backwards vampire.</p>

<p>A: You lost me</p>

<p>Q: I can’t see in the dark, you see.</p>

<p>A: Okay, sure. Whatever. I thought you meant you gave women blood transplants in the neck.</p>

<p>Q: Gross. </p>

<p>A: Right? But you’re the one that said it. Anyway, we’ve strayed pretty far afield. tell me, can you admit to me what these things are that you…do?</p>

<p>Q: Well, you see, I–</p>

<p>A: Remember to keep this family friendly.</p>

<p>Q: How do I say this? I edit spreadsheets.</p>

<p>A: Watch your mouth! We call them “Numbers Documents” around here.</p>

<p>Q: Okay, I edit Numbers Documents, but in Microsoft Products.</p>

<p>A: I thought I told you to watch your mouth!</p>

<p>Q: The problem is that all that white space starts to make my eyes hurt around 11:30 at night, and by 1:00 am I’m walking into walls and all wired and stuff.</p>

<p>A: My friend, I can help.</p>

<p>Q: Can you? Can you really?</p>

<p>A: It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick, but–Well, actually, it’ll be both. But yes, if you’re willing, I can offer you assistance.</p>

<p>Q: But will it be expensive? Because I’m still saving up to buy that nice new serif for little q that she wanted for Quistmas.</p>

<p>A: One more pun like that and so help me…</p>

<p>ENTIRE CAST OF MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL: <strong>GET ON WITH IT!</strong></p>

<p>A: The answer to your problem is F.lux, a program that modifies the brightness of your monitor to match the current light at the time of day. So your screen dims at night, leaving you more ready to sleep and less prone to bump into walls. Just tell it where you live and it’ll do the rest. You’ll never have to think about it again.</p>

<p>Q: But what if I’m doing something that would be terrible if I played with my brightness settings?</p>

<p>A: Then you can tell it to change things back for an hour or so. But for the most part it quietly, subtly changes your brightness to stop destroying your night vision and ability to sleep.</p>

<p>Q: Why the oddly placed dot in the name, though?</p>

<p>A: Some mysteries were meant to stay unsolved, my friend. Savor the mystery. And your less-obliterated night vision.</p>

<p>Q: This I will do. Thank you. You have been most helpful. No, don’t get up, I’ll see myself out. [<em>runs into wall next to door, then finds door. Falls down stairs.</em>]</p>

<p>A: Sure you will.</p>

<p>So, Apple has spammed the iTunes store with “We’re about to do something amazing” type banners, and nobody knows what’s actually coming. Not <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/11/15/itunes-teaser">John Gruber</a>, not <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2010/11/15/an-exciting-announcement-from-itunes-tomorrow/">Andy Ihnatko</a>, not even me. I can’t tell you how happy this makes me. In these days when all corporate secrets are leaked/rumored/left in bars it’s nice to have something come up that actually catches people flatfooted. All the respected technology pundits are stumped, and it’s refreshing and kinda fun.<a href="#footnote_0_1000" title="Also kinda fun: WordPress informs me that this is officially the 1000th post on this site. Happy 1K Day, everyone!">1</a></p>

<p>However, unlike the aforementioned respected technology pundits, I have no reputation for veracity and can therefore speculate like crazy. And since I’m slightly ahead of the curve on my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/429107">NaNoWriMo </a>story, I figured I can spend some time making things up in this world instead of my novel world. These, then, are my terrible guesses about tomorrow’s announcement.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Angry Birds for Mac</strong>. People will be quick to point out that the Mac is already capable of playing Angry Birds and listening to Pandora at the same time, which gives it a significant advantage over the iPad. Right-minded people will continue to wonder why these two apps continue to be the yardstick against which all new OS/hardware combos are measured.</li>
  <li>**iOS 5.0 **“We’re just gonna launch it, and the developers can catch up when they do.” An insanely-pleased-with-himself Steve Jobs will announce.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple buys Oracle</strong>. “THIS is why we’re not making our own Java any more. We just BOUGHT Java! And Solaris. And MySQL. Oh yeah, and that Oracle and PeopleSoft garbage. We’ll EOL those shortly. But hey, what do you all think about ‘iDatabase’ as the new name for MySQL?”<a href="#footnote_1_1000" title="What boundless hatred for Oracle? I don’t have a boundless hatred for Oracle! I keep my hatred for Oracle down to three hours a week max.">2</a></li>
  <li><strong>New iPod Nanos that are actually good again</strong>. “We’re renaming the old ones “ShuffleTouches”, which sounds kinda racy but actually isn’t,” Phil Schiller will explain.</li>
  <li><strong>Free Upgrade to Lion for everyone!</strong><a href="#footnote_2_1000" title="Only in the iTunes Store">3</a> . Apple will get people warmed up for the Mac App Store by making Lion a free upgrade in the current iTunes store. Critics will have a hard time deciding if this is an example of incredible generosity or a cynical way to line up all Apple users like sheep for the shearing as they start to buy all their software via Apple.</li>
  <li><strong>Peter Oppenheimer Will Finally Finish Portal</strong>: Apple’s CFO will finish the iconic first-person-puzzle-shooter on stage and broadcast live via iTunes. “This is a triumph!” Steve Jobs will say. Jonathan Coulton and Natalie Imbruglia<a href="#footnote_3_1000" title="I know she had nothing to do with Portal, but she’s got a nice voice and doesn’t get nearly enough air time these days.">4</a> will then come out on stage and sing an acoustic version of the closing credits song. Everyone who watches the broadcast will have “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI">Still Alive</a>” stuck in their heads for weeks. <em>Again</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple buys Oracle *and *Sweden</strong>. These two acquisitions will be mentioned in passing. The rest of the announcement will be 45 minutes of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive showing off their cool houses they made in <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>. Notch<a href="#footnote_4_1000" title="The developer of Minecraft">5</a> will be named “A National Treasure” and will eventually have to get a restraining order against Jerry Bruckheimer and Nicholas Cage so they will stop trying to steal him from his office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, we could go on, but we’re mild and modest<a href="#footnote_5_1000" title="This is a lie. All bloggers have huge egos.">6</a> and don’t want to look *too *prescient in public. Feel free to put on your tinfoil hat and guess what Apple is up to in the comments.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Also kinda fun: WordPress informs me that this is officially the 1000th post on this site. Happy 1K Day, everyone! [<a href="#identifier_0_1000">↩</a>]</li>
  <li>What boundless hatred for Oracle? I don’t have a boundless hatred for Oracle! I keep my hatred for Oracle down to three hours a week <em>max</em>. [<a href="#identifier_1_1000">↩</a>]</li>
  <li>Only in the iTunes Store [<a href="#identifier_2_1000">↩</a>]</li>
  <li>I know she had nothing to do with Portal, but she’s got a nice voice and doesn’t get nearly enough air time these days. [<a href="#identifier_3_1000">↩</a>]</li>
  <li>The developer of Minecraft [<a href="#identifier_4_1000">↩</a>]</li>
  <li>This is a lie. All bloggers have huge egos. [<a href="#identifier_5_1000">↩</a>]</li>

<p>We don’t have the time to think up a brilliant Q&amp;A session this week as we’re feverishly writing stuff about all knowing techno-smart-alecs and people who might or might not be dryads. So instead we’re going to take a page from other tech commentator’s books and comment on recent news-type events that have happened recently. This should be fun.</p>

<p><strong>Cooks Source Steals Content</strong>: We’re not sure why <a href="http://illadore.livejournal.com/30674.html">this story</a> got such heavy coverage, but it surely did–for about five minutes. Expect this story to die down quickly and nobody on the entire internet to remember anything about Illadore or Cooks Source magazine by the end of next week. This story isn’t really *Apple *related, but it is *apple *related, as the recipe in question was for apple pie.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Hates Flash Round II</strong>: Apple pundits are jumping on the Flash-hating bandwagon, and discovering that the Flash plugin kills laptop batteries faster than something that kills something else in around four hours. So discount spider spray and big hairy spiders maybe. Or hand sanitizer and cold germs. I don’t know. I don’t keep a handy list of things that kill other things in around four hours on my person at all times. That seems kinda morbid. Oh, wait, I got one: “…the Flash Plugin kills laptop batteries faster than The BBC’s eight-hour-long Pride and Prejudice miniseries kills any modern male’s will to live.” Yeah, that’ll work.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Hates the XServe</strong>: Sad but true. Apple will stop making XServes in 2011. We don’t know why. The Mac mini Server is a fearsome piece of technology, but not *that *fearsome, for Pete’s sake. Maybe Apple was looking at the new data centers they’re building and realizing that even they don’t have enough money to fill them with XServes. Maybe they’ve decided that anything even remotely businesslike is outside of their sphere of concern, and in coming months we’ll see an End-of-life announcement for the PowerMac Mac Pro as well. Maybe the future of Apple is wall-to-wall iPads as far as the eye can see, with an occasional MacBook Air thrown in here and there. We’re not sure. All we know is that the one time we were tasked with keeping an XServe up and running it was a finicky, picky diva of a server and made our lives miserable, unlike the Windows and Linux servers we were running alongside it. On the other hand it had the prettiest User Interface, so that has to count for something.</p>

<p><strong>The Big Bang Theory Don’t Know Macs</strong>: In a recent<a href="#footnote_0_993" title=" less than a year old is recent to me">1</a> episode of The Big Bang Theory one of the characters dressed up like an Apple Store “Genius” in order to pick up women. The plausibility of this scenario to one side<a href="#footnote_1_993" title="I spent years working a job that had a minor tech-support component to it. While it’s true that I often assisted a certain six-foot-tall blonde ballerina with her Mac problems there was never any spark of growing romance, nascent ardor, or increasing passion involved with the job. If history has taught us anything, it’s taught us that tech support is not the basis for budding romance.">2</a> , The character says that he was “showing this hot girl how to boot into safe mode…” and that’s what nearly caused me to spew apple cider all over my Apple computer. “Macs don’t have a ‘Safe Mode’!!!” I thought with multiple exclamation points. “Windows has a ‘Safe Mode! There’s no way he could be ‘booting into safe mode’ on a Mac!”</p>

<p>“Unless the hot girl had Boot Camp set up on her machine.” A part of my brain that likes to argue with me suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, yeah, but still, he should be helping her with Apple problems if he’s pretending to be working at the Genius Bar.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the real Geniuses don’t handle Windows problem, and that was his edge.”</p>

<p>“Look, shaddup. You’re ruining my perfectly good sense of outrage here. I get so very few of them.”</p>

<p>“Sorry about that. Okay. As you were.”</p>

<p>But it was no good. The moment was lost. So you can be outraged or not as you choose about this glaring mistake in an otherwise pretty good show.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all we have for today. Feel free to drop any other Appley newsy things you may find relevant in the comments. We’ll be watching the comments with one eye while simultaneously trying to figure out why one of our protagonists is trying to turn into an antagonist and ALSO trying to write at least 1667 words a day.<a href="#footnote_2_993" title="We’ve been told that trying to focus on two different texts will make us blind and insane. But we are not worried. We are a chameleon! We can focus our eyes independent of each other! We may perhaps need to get more sleep so we don’t say stupid things like that.">3</a></p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we look at a program that’s dear to our heart: <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a>.</p>

<p>Q: Oh come on. You’ve been doing Scrivener-heavy posts since you started this site.</p>

<p>A: True, my friend, but it’s never had it’s own iFAQ.</p>

<p>Q: That can’t be right. You wrote a Scrivener iFAQ just last… wait, no, I’ll find it…</p>

<p>A: Hmm, yes, that supposed old post is hard to find, no?</p>

<p>Q: Well, I guess you haven’t done a Scrivener iFAQ.</p>

<p>A: Or perhaps it’s just… <em>disappeared</em>!</p>

<p>Q: Yeah, no. Given your track record you probably just forgot to write it that one week.</p>

<p>A: You know who makes people forget things? GHOSTS. Perhaps you read my old Scrivener iFAQ and your memories of that moment have just been… spirited away.</p>

<p>Q: Dude, stop it. So, why should I use Scrivener? Why not, say <a href="http://storyist.com/index.html">Storyist</a>, <a href="http://www.the-soulmen.com/ulysses/">Ulysses</a>, <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>, Or <a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/products/storymill/">StoryMill</a>? </p>

<p>A: Do not mention the names of those hulking wrecks in my presence<img src="#footnote_0_990" alt="1" title="Note to people who like those hulking wrecks: Some of them are pretty good programs. I have purchased licenses to all of them except Ulysses. Ulysses makes rats barf." /> I bring to you the name of the one angel of goodness and utility and you sully the conversation with sycophants and hangers-on!</p>

<p>Q: That’s…not really what I did at all…</p>

<p>A: Silence! You dare come to my huge crumbling neo-Victorian mansion seeking shelter from the driving rain, and then insult me in my own huge, wood-paneled study with a giant Grandfather clock ticking ominously in the corner!</p>

<p>Clock: TICK…TOCK…TICK…DOOM…TOCK</p>

<p>Q: How did you even get that thing into the studio?</p>

<p>A: That’s nothing, wait until I really get going and start playing my huge pipe organ. Would you like to see my mighty…</p>

<p>Q: Stop it.</p>

<p>A: Sorry. Now, where was I? right, clock, right. Ahem. When I pronounce to you that Scrivener is the most sublime of all writing programs, you can be assured that my statement comes from the wisdom of the ages. Ages through which I have lived and lurked, watching humanity from behind leaden glass, their pomposity and self-importance turning my stomach. Worms. But now the time has come. Now I will have–</p>

<p>Thunder: CRASHHHH! BOOOM<img src="#footnote_1_990" alt="2" title="We only paid for a “Crash”, but Thunder is a bit of a ham" /></p>

<p>A: My revenge!</p>

<p>Q: By advocating people use a good non-linear word processor?</p>

<p>A: Aha! That is but the first step in my plan! A plan so devious, so soul-shaking that strong men will quail and strong women will continue to be really good at stuff<img src="#footnote_2_990" alt="3" title="Have you ever noticed that? My wife is ten times better than me at most things. I mean, she’s driven forklifts on the docks of a salmon processing plant in Alaska, then went inside and fixed some giant machine with some duct tape and a wrench. What’s that all about?" /> Quail, then, mere mortal, at the sheer audacity of my plan!</p>

<p>Q: … I still don’t know what your plan is.</p>

<p>A: Indeed, indeed you don’t! But you shall…after I write a 50,000 word novel about it in November! Then the whole world shall know my plan! Bwahahahahaha!</p>

<p>Thunder: CRK-CRK-BOOOOOOM<img src="#footnote_3_990" alt="4" title="This one was completely improvised, but we kept it." /></p>

<p>Q: So your evil plan is…to take part in NaNoWriMo.</p>

<p>A: And write a novel so terrifying, so soul-shaking that your very soul will be shaken!</p>

<p>Q: Okay, then have fun with that. I’ll just–</p>

<p>A: THERE’S A SPIDER ON YOUR HEAD!</p>

<p>Q: I’ll just be over here. Outside this door. Leaving.</p>

<p>A: Time to start playing the organ!</p>

<p>We here at CANS have been thinking long and hard about the whole Apple-Java thing. And, if you ask us, it’s kinda silly that we’re talking about ourselves in the plural. But we have no intention of stopping now. If we have learned anything from our time blogging we’ve learned that there’s no bad idea that can’t be made worse by sticking to it long after it stopped being useful or funny. This was hard-won knowledge, and we choose to ignore it, as is our constitutional right.</p>

<p>And speaking of rights, it isn’t wrong or right of Apple to stop writing their own </p>

<p>As we count the hours until Apple reveals…whatever it is that Apple is going to reveal later this week, we here at CANS have a simple request for the rest of the tech press:</p>

<p>Please stop predicting a new MacBook Air. </p>

<p>Depending on where you stand on the issue, the MacBook Air is either the best thing Apple’s ever done or is completely obviated by the iPad. Apple either agrees with you or they don’t. Either way, We’re tired of you all talking about it. It’s just not interesting is all. At the end of the day, the Air is just a lil’ ol’ laptop, only it’s not all that much smaller than a MacBook, so it’s just a laptop. </p>

<p>Since you all seem to be having a hard time thinking up better rumors, we’ve decided to break with our long-standing tradition of only writing about made up factual news to give you a few made up rumors upon which to speculate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The new OS will be the horrible, Lovecraftian hybrid of OSX and iOS, similar in scope of failure to Windows ME, and its release will be a moment of utter rejoicing for Windows fans.  </li>
  <li>The new OS will be a blend of OSX, Windows, Linux, and iOS that is so amazing that Linus Torvalds starts using it instead of whatever version of Linux he’s using these days. Steve Ballmer is put out to pasture, which will be a moment of utter rejoicing for all people on earth.  </li>
  <li>Apple will finally release a mid-tower form Mac that has user-upgradeable components other than just the RAM. (I know this one’s so old it’s got whiskers, but we can hope.) Mac users finally start doing well at online games as their graphics capabilities catch up to Windows users.  </li>
  <li>Apple will announce that they have purchased Adobe, and are turning Flash into an HTML5 framework instead of a plugin-based framework. When asked why, Steve Jobs says that the purchase was made “Mostly just to annoy Android developers. All that work making a flash plugin for their phones and BOOM! We make it completely unnecessary.”  </li>
  <li>Apple will announce that they have purchased John Gruber and are turning him into a well-rounded tech commentator instead of a rabid tech commentator. When asked why, Steve Jobs says that the purchase was made “Mostly just to annoy David Pogue. All that work put into becoming a really well-rounded tech columnist with an Apple bias and BOOM! We give the nod to someone else.”  </li>
  <li>In a move that suggests he may have lost his laser-like focus on designing new small electronic devices, Jonathan Ive will spend 20 minutes explaining how he designed the doorknobs for Steve Jobs’ new house.  </li>
  <li>Home Depot and Lowe’s will be sold out of iKnobs for the next six months solid.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, there you have it, tech press! Seven jucy, implausible rumors upon which to speculate instead of hoping that the MacBook Air will get thinner by an eighth of an inch.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we cover Chill Pill, the little feed aggregator that isn’t.</p>

<p>Q: I read a lotta feeds.</p>

<p>A: You got the need to feed.</p>

<p>Q: I NEED to read.</p>

<p>A: This rhyming thing’s gone to seed.</p>

<p>Q: Indeed.</p>

<p>A: So, what’s the problem?</p>

<p>Q: I’ve got the fever…</p>

<p>A: Stand over there please.</p>

<p>Q: No, I mean, I’ve got the <a href="http://feedafever.com">fever feed aggregator</a> running on a server, but I hate using web browsers to browse the web.</p>

<p>A: The inside of your head must be a frightening place.</p>

<p>Q: Some times, my friend. Some times.</p>

<p>A: That to one side, your problem seems to be that you don’t like going on the web to get information from the web.</p>

<p>Q: You make it sound silly.</p>

<p>A: So, what is it you want?</p>

<p>Q: I want a way to read my feeds without using Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Shiira, OmniWeb, or the others.</p>

<p>A: Haven’t we spoken about your browser addiction before?</p>

<p>Q: Yeahhh I really don’t pay much attention to things you say, so It’s unlikely that I’d remember that. You gonna help me or not?</p>

<p>A: Then what’s the…Why do I… *sigh* Okay whatever. Look. You say you’re using fever, right?</p>

<p>Q: Right.</p>

<p>A: Okay then. Use <a href="http://chillpillapp.com/">Chill Pill</a>.</p>

<p>Q: What’s that?</p>

<p>A: It’s a single site browser. And by ‘single site’ I mean it only browses your Fever page. You get all the features of a browser with out any of the freedom!</p>

<p>Q: And that’s a good thing now?</p>

<p>A: Well, it does a few things like let you re-theme your fever, and track how many new items you have, and stuff like that, but pretty much, yeah. Look, ask a stupid question, get a–</p>

<p>Q: AWESOME application! This is perfect! Now I can show off the fact that I’m so rich I spent thirty clams to run software on my own server to basically do what Google reader does for free! It’s the ultimate in hipster techno-snobbery!</p>

<p>A: I saw them once. They were opening for Ironic Grunge Retro. It wasn’t a very good show.</p>

<p>Q: Everyone will be all “oh hey, you must really be in to the news and stuff” and I’ll be all “nah, I just like to keep an eye on things, it’s no big deal” and they’ll think it’s really a big deal in their heads, but they’ll play it off like it’s nothing but I’ll know, Oh, I WILL KNOW that they are full of avarice-flavored angst.</p>

<p>A: This got off on an ugly tangent, so I’m gonna leave now, ‘kay? Okay.</p>

<p>Q: I mean, they’ll already kinda hate me for the way that I carry my big ol’ 17″ MacBookPro around everywhere, and how I spend five minutes whenever we meet somewhere setting up my Magic Mouse and my Magic Trackpad, but the fact that I’m throwing money at things that they do just fine for free will be the final nail in the cake, the frosting on the coffin that makes them start writing poems about my death. This is so much better that I even could have hoped for! Hey, where’d you go?</p>

<p>With Apple’s official <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/10/13/apple-holding-back-to-the-mac-event-on-october-20/">announcement </a>that they *do *remember how to make desktop operating systems the gate has been opened for rampant speculation. We here at CANS have never been above such things, and we see no reason to pretend we are now. Here, then, is our feature list for what looks to be OSX 10.7 “Lion”<a href="#footnote_0_978" title="Might not actually be called “Lion”, but come on. Look at the freakin’ picture. What else are they gonna call it?">1</a> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple finally breaks down and puts Blu-Ray into the Mac. Yeah, that’s too crazy even for us.</li>
  <li>Five, count ‘em *five *new wallpapers!</li>
  <li>Building on the success of the iOS ecosystem, Apple will limit you to seven screens’ worth of apps on your Mac. “How many word processors do you actually need? Steve Jobs will explain.<a href="#footnote_1_978" title="Steve Jobs is perfectly capable of explaining in the form of a question.">2</a></li>
  <li>Apple will announce a new MacBook Air. It will have a touch screen and a detachable keyboard. Critics who point out that it looks a lot like an iPad and keyboard set bundled into one box will never be heard from again.</li>
  <li>Lion will have a new 3D interface that utilizes a living room motif. The Sign-in screen will be the front door, your office apps would be on a desk, your games on a shelf, your movies in an entertainment center, etc. It’ll be high-tech and awesome and everyone will love it. Critics who point out that it’s just an updated version of <a href="http://www.bentuser.com/article.aspx?ID=327&amp;page=2">Microsoft Bob</a> will never be heard from again.</li>
  <li>Apple will stop supporting Adobe Flash on the desktop. “Oh, we have the technology,” Jony Ive will say. “We just like to tweak Adobe every now and again. Besides, who even needs Flash, now that<a href="http://homestarrunner.com/"> Homestar Runner</a> isn’t updating any more?”</li>
</ul>

<p>The possibilities are endless<a href="#footnote_2_978" title="I’m guessing; I could apparently only think of six.">3</a> ! Have a guess? Shout it out loud and proud in the comments.</p>
