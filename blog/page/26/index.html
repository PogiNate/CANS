<p>So, while I was chatting with Steve Jobs on the phone after the “Let’s Rock” event he received a call from John Mayer. I don’t know if he meant to put it on three-way calling, or if he just meant to put me on hold, but this is a transcript of the call:</p>

<p><em>Phone rings</em></p>

<p><strong>Jobs</strong>: Oh crap.  I gotta take this, Moltz. Hold on.</p>

<p><strong>Dickson</strong>: Er, Dickson, actually. But Moltz is fine.</p>

<p><strong>Mayer</strong>: Hey Steve.</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Hi John.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: I saw the keynote today.</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Good, good.</p>

<p>M: You played “Gravity” as a “Genius” example. That was pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Glad you liked that.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: And some of my other songs came up as well.</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Yep.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: But I was surprised, there at the end, when that Hawaiian guy got up on stage.</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Jack Johnson is a very talented artist, and…</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: I had my guitar there with me, Steve.  I was already to go.  What happened?</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Look, John, I know this might be hard for you, but we’ve moved on.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: Moved on? You can’t leave me, Steve! You need me! Apple needs me!</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: John, don’t make this harder than it already is. Bono didn’t get all whiny like this when we stopped making the U2 special edition iPod.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: What about that one keynote? And that other keynote? I rocked the house!</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: You performed adequately, yes, but…</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: I mean, I can understand bringing in Randy Newman from time to time. You basically own his soul, right?</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Well, Pixar did, which means Disney does, so basically yes, but…</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: So he’s okay; he’s fine. But Jack Johnson? Some wimpy hyper-mellow…</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: Maybe I should just go…</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Quiet, Moltz.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: Dickson. But Moltz is fine!</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Whatever. Listen, John, your time has passed. You’ll still show up in cover flows or as a “favorite song” in a playlist here or there but your star has set.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: What’s that Johnson got that I don’t got?</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Grammar, for one.  Also, he’s personable, John. He tells jokes. He connects with the audience.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: I can tell jokes! I can connect!</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: You look like a stuffed iguana trying to sing, John. Let’s face it. You were hot for a while because of that real world song, and that wonderland song, but…(<em>tinny snippet of “<a href="http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/music/detail/curious_george_ost">Upside Down</a>” starts playing</em>) Look, John, it’s over. Goodbye. And Moltz, I told you stop calling me. (<em>click</em>)</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: Dickson… Oh who cares. (<em>to self</em>) I could never be as good as John Moltz…</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>: (<em>to self</em>) I could never be as good as Jack Johnson…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we return to an old favorite who just got a new look. That’s right, <a href="http://runrev.com/home/product-family/">HyperCard</a>!  Er, no, I mean, iTunes 8.</p>

<p>Q; Is iTunes 8 really all that different?</p>

<p>A: Hoo yeah!</p>

<p>Q:…</p>

<p>A:…</p>

<p>Q: Care to elaborate?</p>

<p>A: Sure!  I mean, the genius mode alone is more awesome than a bag of tap dancing penguins.  And then there’s the new grid view for all media types. That’s just awesome. I mean, seriously, what could be more awesome than having ten icons that all say “Dance” on them?</p>

<p>Q: Why would you have ten “dance” genres?</p>

<p>A: Who doesn’t? Techno, DJ, Hip-hop, they’re all “Dance” to iTunes.</p>

<p>Q: O-Okay, whatever. I gotta tell ya, though, I’m just a little worried about the “genius” thing.  Does it really need to send the entire contents of my library to some creepy server in Cupertino?</p>

<p>A: There aren’t any creepy servers in Cupertino!  And anyway, it’s completely anonymous. Just because the server knows that <em>someone</em> has the complete works of Yanni in full, uncompressed 256kbps glory doesn’t mean that it knows who that loser is.</p>

<p>Q:  Heh heh, yeah, what… what kind of loser would have a complete Yanni collection?</p>

<p>A: But what they would know is that a person who listens to the works of Yanni also likes John Tesh, and they can help people build Yanni/Tesh playlists, with some Neil Diamond thrown in to “spice things up”.</p>

<p>Q: Ewww, I don’t like Neil Diamond… I mean, um, yeah, that works.</p>

<p>A: It also helps avoid the embarrassment of Party Shuffle pulling up your <a href="http://crazyapplenews.com/2008/08/friday-ifaq-itunes/">previously-mentioned</a> Vanilla Ice collection when you’re trying to listen to Beck-like music.</p>

<p>Q: That wasn’t me, that was a different FAQ question-asker.</p>

<p>A: There’s more than one of you?</p>

<p>Q: Yes.</p>

<p>A: Strange.</p>

<p>Q: Is it true that the “Genius” will insert any John Mayer you have into any playlist it creates?</p>

<p>A:  It was in beta, but something seems to have come between John Mayer and Apple, and he’s been replaced.  I wonder what could have happened with that relationship<a href="#footnote_0_151" title="foreshadowing">1</a>?</p>

<p>Q: Yes, It’s like there was a painful conversation between them<a href="#footnote_1_151" title="heavy foreshadowing">2</a></p>

<p>A: Well, I guess we’ll never know<a href="#footnote_2_151" title="What could they be talking about?">3</a>.</p>

<p>Q: So now is there some new “most favored artist”?</p>

<p>A: Jack Johnson.</p>

<p>Q: Cool.  So, If I make a genius playlist based on, say, “Penny Lane”, then I’ll get the most Penny-lane-esque Jack Johnson song?</p>

<p>A: Oooh, no can do.  <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/007713.html">iTunes don’t do no Beatles</a>. But you would be amazed how well Johnson’s Hawaiian groove blends with Coltrane.</p>

<p>Q: Awesome.</p>

<p>We’re live here in, well, our office, and covering Apple’s groundbreaking event.</p>

<ul>
<li>Steve looks like he always does.</li>
<li>He’s not dead.</li>
<li>iTunes 8 will tell a “genius in the cloud” that you want to make playlists based on the music of Zamfir and give you a list of songs that will sound good in a mix with pan pipes.</li>
<li>Is this the same cloud where Mobile Me lives?</li>
<li>iPods!</li>
<li>New Nanos! They look suspiciously like the iPod Giga!</li>
<li>That’ll be announced next. You just watch.</li>
<li>Here it comes.</li>
<li>…Or new earbuds. That’s good too.</li>
<li>And a flying rainbow.</li>
<li>Of nanos.</li>
<li>Wow! the new iPod touch looks just like the old iPhone! Kinda!</li>
<li>Nike built in! If only I ever used that, or even wanted to!</li>
<li>Iron Man! I’ll bet he has an iPhone.</li>
<li>Why does John Meyer keep showing up in people’s playlists?</li>
<li>Spore! Wow! that’s…something we all knew about. Phil looks good, though.</li>
<li>It’s like Phil has never seen an iPod before. What’s that all about?</li>
<li>It’s like he wants to, say, kiss each and every pixel on the screen.  Odd.</li>
<li>If I was going to play soccer on my iTouch, it’d be Philippines vs. Finland.  Yeah!</li>
<li>Why do games get all the accelerometer support?  I want a “shake and calc” spreadsheet for the iPhone!</li>
<li>This is the funnest iPod ever”  Is “funnest” a word?</li>
<li>Updates for money? What is Apple thinking?</li>
<li>Here comes the Giga. It’s a “One more thing” type of announcement.</li>
<li>No! No John Mayer! Please! NO! Oh, It’s Jack Johnson. That’s alright then.</li>
<li>Jack Johnson “Let’s Rock” = Mellow, acoustic sounds. Huh.</li>
<li>At least we avoided John Mayer. I can’t stand that little rodent.</li>
<li>I’d be sleeping right now, but there’s all this static.</li>
<li>Aaaand another song.</li>
<li>In what way is Jack Johnson “used to 20-something girls”?</li>
<li>I don’t want to think about Jack’s friends watching him sing love songs to his wife. I really don’t.</li>
<li>Well, that’s all folks. Until next time!</li>

<p>Sure, everyone’s seen the grainy picture of the what is supposed to be the new iPod Nano, but nobody seems to ask “why is that picture so grainy?”</p>

<p><em>Until Now</em>.</p>

<p><em>We</em> asked.  We dug. We searched. We combed the beaches, we combed our hair, we went to distant corners of our house and the Internet and came back with <em>the truth</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that picture is so grainy is because it isn’t a new iPod Nano. Come on. Who wants a new Nano? Nobody. That’s nothing new. That’s not what we should expect from the company that tells us to “Think Different.” That’s like Microsoft announcing Windows 95: The Revenge Of The DOS Shells.</p>

<p>That picture, my friends, is a picture of the new <strong>iPod Giga</strong>. The. Largest. iPod. Ever.</p>

<p>[![The new iPod Giga with a scale picture of Steve Jobs Next to it.][2]][2]
The new iPod Giga with a scale picture of Steve Jobs next to it.</p>

<p>As you can see in this picture, the iPod Giga is only photographable from the air, and that’s why it looks all grainy. For contrast, we superimposed a scale image of Steve Jobs next to the Giga.</p>

<p>“With the Giga, entire cities can experience their music in a whole new way,” says a source who requested anonymity, regardless of how hard that word is to spell. “1200 Petabytes of storage. A full-size IMAX screen. over 500 headphone jacks. A click wheel the size of a Buick. With the arrival of the Giga, no one can call iPods anti-social ever again.”</p>

<p>“Steve is pretty excited about the Giga project,” said another unnamed, but highly placed inside source. “The body is made from the same stuff they use to build space shuttles, and the screen–Oh, the screen!– it’s built by the IMAX people, has like, 40 gazillion pixels, and looks so good you would want to kiss each one. On the lips. I mean, I do. Want to, I mean; Steve won’t let me kiss them.  Or him.”</p>

<p>Neither source would give an exact cost, but both said it would be “attractively priced, if the whole city chips in”.</p>

answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy<br/>
Apple products.</p>

<p>This week ends our tour of iLife with the black sheep of the family, the one who didn’t have the common decency to take the family prefix.  That’s right, I’m looking at <em>you</em>, GarageBand.</p>

<p>Q: How do I make myself sound awesome in GB?</p>

<p>A: In Great Britian?  I dunno, try saying something like, “Today is gonna be the day that they’re gonna throw it back to you.”</p>

<p>Q: Cute.</p>

<p>A: Thanks!</p>

<p>Q: You know what I mean.</p>

<p>A: Alright, look, what kind of music are you trying to play?</p>

<p>Q: Oh, I’m thinking something that sounds like the Talking Heads meet They Might Be Giants.</p>

<p>A: Okay, then you’re in with a chance.  I’ll level with you: GarageBand is good for two things: Making podcasts and techno-sounding music.</p>

<p>Q: There’s one problem, though. I don’t know how to play any instruments.</p>

<p>A: Well, there’s a way around that as well.  You see, in GarageBand, your credit card is the most versatile musical instrument there is!</p>

<p>Q: Ummm…</p>

<p>A: All you have to do is march your backside down to the nearest Apple store and buy every Jam Pack there is! Then you have millions of pre-recorded loops that you can mash together and pretend you have talent.  It’s just like being a member of *NSYNC, but without the dancing!</p>

<p>Q: So, GarageBand will help me spend money?</p>

<p>A: Sure!  Oh, you could use one of the “Magic GarageBand” settings and just let your lack of talent shine in the midst of Apple’s pre-recorded talent on the other four tracks, but why force Apple’s robots to help you play terrible music when you can do that just fine on your own?</p>

<p>Q: Hey, pal, I play great alterna-techno-reggae…</p>

<p>A: I mean, terrible music should be something you do on your own, in private, and never share, lest the others all gather around and mock you.</p>

<p>Q: Here we go again…</p>

<p>A: Their disdain evident on their faces, and in every gesture.  Sure, they say they like you, but in reality they’re just looking for a new chance, a fresh opportunity to <em>cut you down</em>, man, and you can’t…</p>

<p>Q: SLAP!</p>

<p>A: … Thanks.</p>

<p>Q: One more question?</p>

<p>A: Sure.</p>

<p>Q: What should I call my band?</p>

<p>A: They Might be Talking Giant Heads.</p>

<p>Q: Awesome.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and<br/>
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy<br/>
Apple products.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each<br/>
week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we<br/>
will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This Week: that greatest of all “jukebox” programs, a great app and a close personal friend, please give a warm, Crazy Apple News Site round of applause to: iTunes<img src="#footnote_0_104" title=" Yes, iTunes is technically part of iLife.  Even though it’s  a free download and runs on Windows." alt="1" /></p>

<p>Q: How can I copy music off of my friend’s iPod into my iTunes library?</p>

<p>A: Erm, I don’t think I should be telling you <a href="http://fadingred.org/senuti/">how to do things</a> that are against your agreement with Apple.</p>

<p>Q: Jerk.</p>

<p>A: Boogerhead.</p>

<p>Q: Dorkface.</p>

<p>A: …But enough of this witty repartee. Do you have any <em>legal</em> questions about iTunes?</p>

<p>Q: Fine.  Okay, here’s one for you.  In Windows Media Player I can just drag songs I want to listen to into the “Now Playing” bar and they queue up and play in order.  Why can’t I do something like that in iTunes?</p>

<p>A: You can add them to the party shuffle playlist and they will be played in the order you supply.</p>

<p>Q: Yes, and after the  sweet, haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata fade quietly into the darkness and you are considering the majesty of creation and Man’s place in it you suddenly get “Baby Got Back”, because Party Shuffle is about as intelligent and sensitive as a dragon in a store that sells wedding dresses.</p>

<p>A: Why do you even <em>have</em> “Baby Got Back” in your iTunes library?</p>

<p>Q: What? That’s not the point. And you completely ignored my witty allegory.</p>

<p>A: It was a simile. What else do you have in there? “Bust a Move”, by Young MC? Maybe some Kriss Kross? How about Marky Mark’s #1 Jam “Good Vibrations”?</p>

<p>Q: What’s wrong with you?</p>

<p>A: I’m just trying to figure out why you are still listening to novelty rap from the early-to-mid nineties.</p>

<p>Q: Look, I don’t have all of M.C. Hammer’s albums tucked away in my iPod, alright? It was just an example, and  you are still totally ignoring my question…</p>

<p>A: I’ll bet you <em>do</em> have a complete M.C. Hammer collection! I’ll bet you even have the oft-overlooked, but actually quite excellent “Let’s Get it Started” album!</p>

<p>Q: …And you are the one that seems to know all about the novelty rap songs.  How’s that C C Music Factory tape holding up after all these years?  Thought about making the jump to CD any time soon?</p>

<p>A: Oh, I bought that one on CD back– hey!</p>

<p>Q: Thought so.</p>

<p>A: Whatever. Jus’ shut up.</p>

<p>Q: Well, I’m not getting any useful answers out of you when you’re in this mood, so I’ll leave you to your VHS copies of Yo! MTV Raps!.</p>

<p>A: At least I don’t make playlists with “Moonlight Sonata” and “Baby Got Back” in them. Say “hi” to the New Kids on the Block for me. Geek.</p>

<p>Q: Poser.</p>

<p>A: Nerd….</p>

<p>Microsoft feels that the best way to counteract the market’s move towards Apple products is to hire <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26327409/">Jerry Seinfeld</a> to appear with Bill Gates<a href="#footnote_0_98" title="How long should I wait until I start calling him things like “Dorky McSweatervest”?  Is that toothbrush still in use?">1</a>  in an attempt to get people to take Vista seriously.</p>

<p>Well, this makes perfect sense to us here at CANS.  I mean, look at how much Apple’s stock has gone up in the last few months since CANS went live!  Clearly, there is a link between the number of people who make jokes about a computing platform and how popular it is.</p>

<p>The great thing is that we all know this is only the beginning. If this Seinfeld thing works at all, they’ll buy up every comedian they can get, and I for one can’t wait.  Personally, I’m hoping that <a href="http://www.poprock80s.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/carrottop.jpg">Carrot</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_Top">Top</a> is the next one tapped to hawk Mr. Ballmer’s wares. I feel his painful, grating voice and irritatingly over-the-top appearance would make him the truest face of Windows Vista. The fact that he seems to be putting on insane amounts of muscle–presumably to get people to stop making fun of him–only adds to the appeal. But until that’s official, why don’t we all guess about it for a while. Make this a more interactive post for once.  Why don’t you all talk about it? Who do you think Microsoft should hire to try to make Apple look less attractive?</p>

<p>Talk amongst yourselves.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and<br/>
answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy<br/>
Apple products.</p>

<p>In an effort to stop worrying about what we’re going to write each<br/>
week, we have declared August iLife Month. Every Friday this month we<br/>
will be writing about a member of Apple’s creativity suite.</p>

<p>This Week: iDVD</p>

<p>Q: Ummm…. I really can’t think of any questions about iDVD.  I mean, it’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it?</p>

<p>A: Is it?  Maybe there are more questions than you thought.</p>

<p>Q: No, not really.  I mean, you do all the hard work in iMovie, so when you export it into iDVD all you really have to do is choose a menu style and you’re golden.</p>

<p>A: That <em>may</em> be true.  Or perhaps… perhaps your limited mind isn’t ready for the awesome power that is iDVD.</p>

<p>Q: Hmmm… Nope, nope, I just read the iDVD help file. I don’t see any “awesome power” section.  Just different ways to set up menus.</p>

<p>A: Perhaps you are asking the wrong sort of question to fully unlock the grandeur of iDVD.</p>

<p>Q: I think I would need to unlock the grammar of that sentence first.</p>

<p>A: That’s the pot calling the kettle stupid<a href="#footnote_0_95" title=" Yes, I know how the saying is supposed to go. I just changed it for slightly comedic effect. Please don’t go around correcting my aphorisms.">1</a> .  But go. I see you are not yet ready. You do not have the thirst for knowledge, for ultimate DVD-authoring power, that marks one of the truly prepared users of <strong>iDVD: Master of Secrets</strong>.</p>

<p>Q: Whoa whoa whoa, no fair giving programs subtitles all willy-nilly<a href="#footnote_1_95" title="Did you know that “willy-nilly is a corrupted form of “will he or nill he”? Now you know what that ridiculous word means!">2</a>. Besides, “<strong>iDVD: Master of Secrets</strong>“? Sounds like some kind of stupid B science fiction sequel.</p>

<p>A: Those who mock iDVD are not ready for its secrets. I will answer no more questions today. Farewell.</p>

<p>Q: Well, actually I did have one question…</p>

<p>A: Really? Okay! I’ll answer it! What’s your question? Tell me tell me!</p>

<p>Q: Gotcha!  I don’t actually have a question about <strong>iDVD: The Most Straightforward Program</strong>.  I just wanted to see how long you could hold out not answering a question.</p>

<p>A: Ahem. Yes, begone with you! No longer may you insult the oracle of iDVD’s power.  I shall return now to… oh whatever. I’m going home. Jerk.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the new Mobile Me platform Apple has extended all users’ accounts by at least 90 days, as an apology for the flawed and awkward rollout process. But that just isn’t enough for Steve Jobs, who in a recent meeting decided that the executive board of Apple need to take this “to the next level” and personally apologize to each and every Mobile Me subscriber by bringing them a plate of cookies.</p>

<p>“Starting this Friday, the entire executive team will be out delivering cookies to those whom we have inconvenienced through this Mobile Me launch process,” states an internal memo that was leaked to CANS early this morning.  Our inside source says that Jobs “feels deeply” for all the people who have “had to live without being able to push their calendars to their iPhones and their MacBooks in the same minute” and would like to make it up to them.</p>

<p>This move has been well received by the pundit community.  “It’ll be nice to see Steve Jobs again,” says Merlin Mann, “I mean, I see him all the time already, ’cause he’s always hanging out at my house. But, you know, he’s been busy lately and hasn’t had time to drop by for a while. But we’re totally friends. I’m serious.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the various Apple execs are working on their individual door approaches.  From Jobs’ typically restrained “We’re sorry that we failed you, here’s some insanely great cookies” to Phil Shiller’s “these cookies are a financially insignificant way to let you know that we care for you personally,” the entire board is working on letting people know that Apple values them and feels their pain.</p>

<p>Details have not surfaced about the size or quantity of the cookies to be distributed, but some blurry photos that could be from the Apple Kitchen reveal the cookies to be Oatmeal Raisin.</p>
