<p>Self interest has curtailed interest in gathering to celebrate the latest release of OSX, promised later this month.</p>

<p>“Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy hanging out with other people talking on their iPhon 4’s, while tweeting on their iPads, but it’s different this time,” said a young man wearing glasses that would have been in vogue in the late 50’s and a hairstyle that looked like somebody stuck his hair in a blender with a bunch of used motor oil and turned it on. “But if we all get together and try to download Lion at the same time it’ll slow all of us down. Sure, Apple may have a huge new data center in North Carolina, but we’ve got a 5Mbps connection on this end, and you can only pass so many downloads over that at a time.”</p>

<p>Several Apple Sophisticates have suggested having “*Apres Load” *where everyone brings their newly lionized MacBooks to a party and discuss how awesome the world is now that their trackpads do neat tricks, but “it’s just not the same” moaned a person of indeterminate gender into their faux-martini. </p>

<p>Several of the more seasoned apple faithful were also somewhat at a loss as to how to celebrate the new OS in a manner that truly commemorated one of the most economical and at the same time most graphically inhanced versions of OSX without crowding each other bandwidth-wise. “If we could set up some sort of AppleTalk protocol to share the file from system to system it would be different, but this new Mac App Store doesn’t really work that way.” Said a person who drew blank stares from the hipster graphic design community when he said AppleTalk. “Is that like, networking stuff? Like, an airport?” one of them timidly suggested. “My IT guys take care of all that stuff for me.”</p>

<p>One person in the back made a wizard of Oz joke, but nobody thought it was funny.</p>

<p>Apple was unlikely to comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>A number<a href="#footnote_0_1132" title="two">1</a> of people are up in arms about the recent<a href="#footnote_1_1132" title="well, recent-ish">2</a> announcement that OSX 10.7 aka “Lion” will only be available for 64-bit Intel processors, leaving everyone who is still using a 32-bit “Core Duo” Mac out in the cold. With their Snow Leopard. </p>

<p>“It’s like they don’t even care about us any more,” Said W. H. Iner, president of MOWERS<a href="#footnote_2_1132" title="Mac Owners Who Eschew RISC-based Systems">3</a> . We happily moved over to the new Intel chips as quick as possible, and six months later Apple replaced our beloved “Core Duo” chips with “Core 2 Duo” chips. That name doesn’t even make sense, by the way. How does the “2” in the middle of “Core” and “Duo” mean 64-bit instead of 32-bit?”</p>

<p>Neither Apple nor Intel deigned to respond, but mathematicians were quick to point out that 32*2 does indeed equal 64.</p>

<p>“It’s like they want us to all buy new Apples every five years or something,” Iner continued. </p>

<p>While Apple was still silent on this point, economists would be forced to conclude that, being a company that sells computer hardware, it would be in Apple’s best interest for their customers to replace their computer hardware on a regular basis.</p>

<p>“After all, how hard can it be to just sort of translate all their precious 64-bit code into 32-bit code for us to use? It wouldn’t run that much slower, and then we could use all the shiny new features like Launchpad and that new Expose thingy.”</p>

<p>Apple has yet to provide a reply to this claim, but several Computer Scientists brains exploded before they were able to provide a coherent reply. Jumbled statements about “exponential complexity” and “blazingly stupid people” were amongst their final words. One was able to calmly address the second point, noting that the video cards in these systems would now be considered underpowered even by Apple’s fairly lax standards, and the fancy new graphical thingies in Lion would look “incredibly terrible” on the six year old hardware.</p>

<p>“I just don’t know how Apple can expect to keep growing if they ignore their user’s needs after just six years,” Iner concluded.</p>

<p>While we are still awaiting a response from Apple on this point, but economists mildly reminded us that Apple is one the largest and fastest-growing companies on the planet at this point. How the lack of sales to the members of MOWERS would affect this statistic has yet to be seen.</p>

<p>Long have I wandered, friendless<a href="#footnote_0_1129" title="Except for my wife, kids, and friends">1</a> and alone<a href="#footnote_1_1129" title="see above exception">2</a> in distant lands. Far have I driven, far have I flown, and when I was not flying or driving I was playing host to a host of visitors from foreign climes<a href="#footnote_2_1129" title="Idaho and Alaska mostly">3</a>. Thus do I seek to excuse my lack of Apple-centered craziness for the last few weeks.<a href="#footnote_3_1129" title="Also I got a new job, but that’s no big deal">4</a>.</p>

<p>And what have I learned? What treasures do I bring from my sojourns? Treasures of knowledge? Rich spices from Idaho? Alligator teeth and knowledge of the fountain of youth from Florida? Red Dirt from Moab? Well, yes to the last one. LOTS of red dirt. So much red dirt. Seriously, half of southern Utah is still in my wife’s Suburban. But rich spices from Idaho? What do you want? Beet sugar? Potatoes? They have those. But I was in Boise, where all they have is a mall and lots of suburbs. And Trees. And a river. No spices though, is my point. Not a spice-laden region of earth. </p>

<p>But, I have just invented one treasure that I bring to you, a genuine, made up letter from Steve Jobs to all Apple employees, titled “Some Thoughts On Being the Best”</p>

<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-being-the-best">Some Thoughts on Being the Best</h2>

<p>Heed me, O Minions,</p>

<p>The great day is soon upon us. The war that started with the humble iPod has seen its killing stroke in the iPad. We now rule the mobile world. Let us therefore celebrate! Make glad! Feast we now on ambrosia and drink we deep the mead of victory!</p>

<p>In your case this means you get an extra fifteen minutes on your lunch break this Tuesday. Being drunk on work time is still a firing offense. </p>

<p>But we must not stop now. There are still those who have sought to cast aspersions on our rise, magnifying our few flaws into “gates”, seeking to embarrass us. This shall not stand.</p>

<p>Also, Phil Schiller shall no longer stand next to me. He’s too tall. But I digress. Elegantly, intelligently, perhaps, but it’s digression nonetheless.</p>

<p>Many of you have wondered at the new campus, and indeed you should, for it is a wonder of the modern world. But why? Why have we put the time into making this round wonder, and what inspired its design?</p>

<p>Well, the click wheel of course. But there’s more to it than that.</p>

<p>Soon, our masterpiece will be finished, then shall the chosen employees be taken up in our new Campus to the true new campus: The moon.</p>

<p>Yes, in order that we may escape the slings and arrows of outrageous Windows users, all key Apple employees will be lifted to Apple Luna, our new campus on the near side of the moon. This position will give us many advantages, not least of which is the fact that on the moon I can expect to live a good thirty or forty more years, and by that time I expect that we’ll have some kind of immortality treatment. But again, I digress. </p>

<p>From our inaccessible fortress we will watch them fight each other, Windows vs. Linux and periodically we shall send down our blessings upon them in the form of new mobile operating systems and Jony’s latest thinking in industrial design. </p>

<p>He’s really into pleather lately, so expect some interesting new iPads, by the way.</p>

<p>Apple Luna will be ecologically sound, as there is currently no plant or animal life on the moon. Our terraforming efforts will begin immediately, and we expect that in a few years we will be ready to open the houses on One Lunar Loop. Until then you’ll all be basically living at your desks. But the cafeteria will be cheaper, in recognition of the unique situation you’ve been put in, which is to say, fully dependent on Apple for all food and housing and everything. </p>

<p>Those of you who have not been assigned desks in the new complex probably don’t need to worry about packing. After all, we need a few people here planetside to keep things on track. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Steve.</p>

<p>Tired of snow, wind, rain, and all the related weather systems? So are we. That’s why we at CANS HQ are packing the whole shebang into one personal item and one carry-on item and flying to Orlando FL for a week.</p>

<p>The fact that our employer is paying us to go to some sort of conference thingy there doesn’t enter into it at all. We’re just going to see what kinds of uses alligators have for iPads, and if the iPhone 4 has invaded the magic kingdom. Although truthfully, unless someone other than our own illustrious selves unbelts for magic kingdom admission, we’ll probably stick to less-magical kingdoms and keep hold of our mundane but useful pictures of dead presidents.</p>

<p>Also, let us all hope that, at the end of the trip, I can say with absolute honesty “no hard drives were injured in the making of this week’s articles.” Unlike last time.</p>

<p>Today we thought we’d do an in-depth, hard hitting review of the Mac App Store, <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>’s newest way to cash in on developers distribute software. But then we remembered we write  a humor blog, not one of those Gawker monstrosities. So instead we’re just going to make fun of it.<a href="#footnote_0_1120" title="Which may or may not involve hitting things hard.">1</a></p>

<h3 id="app-store-huh-what-is-it-good-for">(App) Store? Huh. What is it good for?</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>The easy answer of course is “absolutely nothing”. But the problem with the path of “the easy answer” is twofold: first, it curtails actual thought, instead lulling us to sleep with its facile nature. Also, it makes for really short articles.</p>

<p>True, at first glance, the App Store doesn’t seem to add a lot to the end user’s experience. It gives you automatic updating…kind of. It’s automatic in the sense of “you get notified that there are updates every time you open the App Store, then you have to download them by yourself” instead of the sense of “happens, you know, <em>automatically</em>”. True, the <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle framework</a> handles this much easier<a href="#footnote_1_1120" title="and doesn’t cost the developer 30% of their sale price">2</a> and prompts you to update when you open the actual <em>app</em>, instead of the App <em>Store</em>, but that’s not the point. The point is that now the user, any user, can find a wealth of apps all in one place, without mucking about on the dirty messy scary internet. So that’s a benefit to the user.</p>

<p>Well, it would be, except the majority of the apps on the App Store are, well, terrible. Sure, you’ve got all the good ones, Like <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Mars Edit</a><a href="#footnote_2_1120" title="which I would be using to write this post if I could afford a license.">3</a> All of Apple’s awesome software, The <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">Omni group’s</a> usual offerings, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But these are well-established players in the game of Mac Software. For the most part they’re in the store just because it’s easy, and it’s more-or-less free advertising<a href="#footnote_3_1120" title="App Store costs aren’t much higher than maintaining your own distribution channel or using other third parties, and are much lower than selling software the old fashioned way, with discs and boxes and stuff. Look, let’s not get into this here, okay?">4</a> and a pretty high chance that they’ll be a featured app, and that just can’t be bad. But what about the stuff that’s never been available anywhere but the App Store? Are there any real standout players that are just getting into the game, and are getting into it via the shiny new Apple-sanctioned distribution channel?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Sure, we’ve got a lot of iPad apps coming “Back to the Mac”. Apparently the refactor from magical touch-screen device to revolutionary and finely tuned desktop computer isn’t that difficult, and there are all kinds of Angry Birds on the mac now.<a href="#footnote_4_1120" title="Angry Birds just looks stupid on a 23” screen, by the way">5</a> But what about the rest of the store? Well, it’s…the kind of thing we’ve come to expect on the iOS app store. A tiny little app that costs you $.99 and lets you track your weight is acceptable on a phone, but it just looks stupid on a desktop. So what happened? Why aren’t we getting the kind of buy-in to the Mac App Store that made the iOS App Store such a huge deal and spawned a thousand copycats? Let’s look at it from the software creator’s point of view.</p>

<h3 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-a-developer">A Day in the Life of a Developer</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>So there you are, a fervent Apple fan boy or girl who has the best possible idea for a new app: the Kittenizer. Soon people worldwide will be posting pictures made better by the artistic and subtle addition of giant Impact-font additions to their images, all drawn from their Twitter and Facebook feeds. The muse grips you, and you must get your program out to the world. But how?</p>

<p>Well, who’s your audience? If you want to write in a cross-platform language, like Java or Flex, then you’re locked out of the Mac App Store. No big deal, you’ll write a Windows version later.</p>

<p>So, that means you’re learning Cocoa and Objective-C. Cool. So you start writing your app, and genius that you are, you have it ready to go in less than eight hours.<a href="#footnote_5_1120" title="I called this section “A Day in the Life” and I mean to stick to it. Even if it means becoming really really implausible in the process.">6</a> Your beta testers<a href="#footnote_6_1120" title="your mom, your sister, and your sister’s boyfriend">7</a> all rave about the app, and it hasn’t had a major crash in <em>minutes</em>. So now you’re off to the races! Let’s get that App in the App Store and out where everyone can know the joy of your buzzword-powered masterpiece.</p>

<p>Not so fast! First you need to cough up $99. Just like the iOS Store, there’s a bar that says “you must be this well off to ride this ride” before you get into the Magic Kingdom. So you go to your beta testers and some other friends and scrape together the money, pay Apple, and make your way through their steps to get your product out there. And after you submit your app, you sit back, looking forward to the moment when your app goes on sale, when you’re getting rewarded for your brilliance. How knows, maybe you’ll even end up as a featured app, or maybe you’ll get a huge award at next year’s WWDC! Maybe your app will even get–</p>

<p>Rejected.</p>

<p>What? Why? You scan the email, and, it’s insanely vague. Don’t worry, young one, you’re <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1854/marsedit-3-2-2">not alone</a>. Still undeterred, you spend a few minutes getting Sparkle built into your app<a href="#footnote_7_1120" title="it doesn’t require any code changes, it lives in Interface Builder">8</a> and a few hours setting up a system that handles activations and whatnot. Finally, just before midnight the Kittenizer is up and for sale on your own personal website.</p>

<h3 id="in-the-end">In the End…</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>It looks like we’re really really down on the Mac App Store. And while we don’t think it’s the best idea in the world, it’s not entirely terrible. But a platform that’s antagonistic to both the developer <em>and</em> the customer is a platform that could use some more love and attention, or else it’s going to end up like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_Software#Zune_Marketplace">Zune Marketplace</a>, and nobody wants that.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we seek for some solace in nostalgia with the advent of <a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a>, a skinnable iTunes controller.</p>

<p>Q: A What-able what now? What is the madness you are saying with your face?</p>

<p>A: Oh, come on, we were all there. Remember the early 2000’s when you were finally able to play music on your computer, and you had all these cool skins for your music player?</p>

<p>Q: No.</p>

<p>A: Sure you do. You could make it look like a brain, and the buttons were made out of wrinkles on the brain’s surface, or you could have it look like a big piano with the control buttons outlined on the keys, or whatever.</p>

<p>Q: Nope! </p>

<p>A: Wow, did you miss out. All the music players did it. Windows Media Player, Winamp, RealPlayer…</p>

<p>Q: All windows programs you’ll notice.</p>

<p>A: Er, well, see, I didn’t get my first mac until 2006, so…</p>

<p>Q: Well, for those of us who have always used good computers we’ve used boring, gray old iTunes and liked it. We don’t need your silly skinnable thingies.</p>

<p>A: But look, you’ve got a chance now! Bowtie is free in the Mac App Store, and you can have a little player that shows you what album you’re listening to, has all your controls, and is really really out of the way AND cool looking, all at the same time!</p>

<p>Q: I don’t really see the point…</p>

<p>A: AND it lets you love or ban songs on Last.fm, so people know what you think about the music you’re listening to! That’s something we couldn’t do back in the day, back with dumb ol’ web 1.0</p>

<p>Q: So there really isn’t a point.</p>

<p>A: The point is to have fun! Come on, it’s spring! The sky is bright, life is good, maybe you should loosen up a bit too! Sometimes things can just be fun. I’m using it to listen to the Tron: Legacy soundtrack right now, just because I can! </p>

<p>Q: Hmmm, not sure I can lower my standards of “fun” quite that far.</p>

<p>A: *sigh*. Okay, Mr. Boring Pants. Go watch your news programs and listen to your collection of the 100 greatest renditions of <em>4’.33”</em> I’ll catch you later.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, get more out of your Crazy Apple products. </p>

<p>This week, it’s all about Twitter’s creatively named Twitter client: Twitter for Mac <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#stupidname">#stupidname</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/Ilikehashtags">#Ilikehashtags</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: So what’s the big deal with Twitter in the first place? Lots of short messages flying around all over the place, forcing people to abbrev</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Ah, so we’re doing that, are we? all our questions and answers have to be less than 140 characters?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yep! It’ll help you stop whinging( on about stupid crap. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#justsayin">#justsayin</a> </p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: So the point is to get us all to distill the essence of what we want to say, to refine our thinking and use every letter effectively?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, I think originally it was just because that was the length of a standard text message. <a href="http://twitter.com/Pogue">@Pogue</a> would know. He’s like, a Twitter god.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: 138, 139, 140. Wow, you’re way too good at getting EXACTLY 140 characters in there. Should I be scared?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Why? It’s just a way to communicate with people, and get a sense of what’s going on in the world around us.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Okay, whatever. I’m going to allow–for the moment–that Twitter has validity as a form of communication. But why do I need an app?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, it makes it easier to see what’s happened in your feed, post replies…</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Easier than going to a web site? That does the exact same thing?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, for one thing, the app wastes far less screen space with stupid things like <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#trendingtopics">#trendingtopics</a>. Seriously, I hate those.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: And yet you linked to a discussion about them. Odd. </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yeah, sorry about that. It gets to be a habit after a while. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#Ijustcannotstopmyself">#Ijustcannotstopmyself</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Yeah, I’m still not sold. Not just on the client either. I don’t see a real point for Twitter in general.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, there’s not much I can say to change your mind. It’s all free, so you can try it out, see if you like it. </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: The name is very appropriate: there’s a lot of tweets, like birds in a tree, but they’re all really short and not a big deal. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#nobigdeal">#nobigdeal</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Almost thou convincest me to become a…what exactly? Tweeter? Twit? Bird?</p>

<p>A: Yeah, nobody’s really sure. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#ohwell">#ohwell</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="section"></h1>

<p>Completely non-shocking news from Cupertino today as it’s revealed that only around 40% of <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> Employees actually <em>use</em> Apple’s new <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/ping/">Ping</a> service.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem to be very useful,” said Pre Tend, who asked to remain nameless. “I tried it for a while, but none of my friends are on there, and everybody’s already on Facebook. So I just use that.”</p>

<p>“I go through the motions. I mean, I’ll review a song or two every so often,” said P. Schilller, who asked that we not identify him in this article. “Just to keep Steve and Tim happy, you know. I’ll review a song or something. But really, who wants everyone to know when they’re listening to <em>Inna Gadda Da Vida</em> for the fifth time that day? Er, not that I’ve done that. I think…I think Scott does that.”</p>

<p>There are others who say that the service provides a vibrant link between fans and artists, and that it’s just getting started. Unfortunately we were unable to reach any of them for comment. Officially, Apple remains confident that Ping will eventually be like Facebook without the freedom. When asked for a comment on the results of the study, an Apple spokesperson said “hey that’s 40% than the national average! So things are looking up!”</p>

<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Listen, guys, we’ve got to get this right. </p>

<p><strong>Phil Schiller</strong>: Okay, sorry, Tim. We’re ready this time.</p>

<p><strong>Cook</strong>: Good. Okay, one, two, three, four!</p>

<p><strong>Peter Oppenheimer</strong>: A-wheem a way, a wheem a way…</p>

<p><strong>Jony Ive</strong>: In the iMac, the peaceful iMac, Lion’s been installed!</p>

<p><strong>Scott Forstall</strong>: De-we-um-um-a-way!</p>

<p><strong>Ive</strong>: On the MacBook, the 13” MacBook, Lion’s been installed!</p>

<p><strong>Forstall</strong>: WEEEEEEEEEE-de-de-de a Whum-a-way!</p>

<p><strong>Schiller</strong>: Hush my darling, iOS and Lion, share lots of good ideas. Full-screen apps and, gestures for actions, make Lion excellent!</p>

<p><strong>Forstall</strong>: Hey! Hey! Whoa-a-wo! Whoa-a-wo a Wheem-o-whum-whum-a-way!</p>

<p><strong>Schiller</strong>: Wait, wait, Tim, he’s doing it again.</p>

<p><strong>Cook</strong>: What’s wrong Phil?</p>

<p><strong>Schiller:</strong> Scott keeps singing his weem-o-whum-a-ways over the top of my words.</p>

<p><strong>Ive:</strong> Also, I only have one line, despite the fact that I’m the best looking of us. </p>

<p><strong>Forstall:</strong> I’m angry that my verse about beta testers being amazing was cut!</p>

<p>**John Mayer: **I’m mad that I’m not invited to sing at these events any more</p>

<p>**Cook: **Who let lizard boy in here? [on intercom] Security! John Mayer broke in again.</p>

<p><strong>Oppenheimer:</strong> I still think it should be pronounced “Wheem o whip!”</p>

<p><strong>Forstall:</strong> Look, Pete, we’ve been over this. That’s clearly not how you say it—</p>

<p><strong>Schiller:</strong> Why are we worrying about how you say it? We should just worry about the fact that Scott keeps singing over my lines!</p>
