<p>Tired of snow, wind, rain, and all the related weather systems? So are we. That’s why we at CANS HQ are packing the whole shebang into one personal item and one carry-on item and flying to Orlando FL for a week.</p>

<p>The fact that our employer is paying us to go to some sort of conference thingy there doesn’t enter into it at all. We’re just going to see what kinds of uses alligators have for iPads, and if the iPhone 4 has invaded the magic kingdom. Although truthfully, unless someone other than our own illustrious selves unbelts for magic kingdom admission, we’ll probably stick to less-magical kingdoms and keep hold of our mundane but useful pictures of dead presidents.</p>

<p>Also, let us all hope that, at the end of the trip, I can say with absolute honesty “no hard drives were injured in the making of this week’s articles.” Unlike last time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Today we thought we’d do an in-depth, hard hitting review of the Mac App Store, <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>’s newest way to cash in on developers distribute software. But then we remembered we write  a humor blog, not one of those Gawker monstrosities. So instead we’re just going to make fun of it.<a href="#footnote_0_1120" title="Which may or may not involve hitting things hard.">1</a></p>

<h3>(App) Store? Huh. What is it good for?</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>The easy answer of course is “absolutely nothing”. But the problem with the path of “the easy answer” is twofold: first, it curtails actual thought, instead lulling us to sleep with its facile nature. Also, it makes for really short articles.</p>

<p>True, at first glance, the App Store doesn’t seem to add a lot to the end user’s experience. It gives you automatic updating…kind of. It’s automatic in the sense of “you get notified that there are updates every time you open the App Store, then you have to download them by yourself” instead of the sense of “happens, you know, <em>automatically</em>”. True, the <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle framework</a> handles this much easier<a href="#footnote_1_1120" title="and doesn’t cost the developer 30% of their sale price">2</a> and prompts you to update when you open the actual <em>app</em>, instead of the App <em>Store</em>, but that’s not the point. The point is that now the user, any user, can find a wealth of apps all in one place, without mucking about on the dirty messy scary internet. So that’s a benefit to the user.</p>

<p>Well, it would be, except the majority of the apps on the App Store are, well, terrible. Sure, you’ve got all the good ones, Like <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Mars Edit</a><a href="#footnote_2_1120" title="which I would be using to write this post if I could afford a license.">3</a> All of Apple’s awesome software, The <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">Omni group’s</a> usual offerings, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But these are well-established players in the game of Mac Software. For the most part they’re in the store just because it’s easy, and it’s more-or-less free advertising<a href="#footnote_3_1120" title="App Store costs aren’t much higher than maintaining your own distribution channel or using other third parties, and are much lower than selling software the old fashioned way, with discs and boxes and stuff. Look, let’s not get into this here, okay?">4</a> and a pretty high chance that they’ll be a featured app, and that just can’t be bad. But what about the stuff that’s never been available anywhere but the App Store? Are there any real standout players that are just getting into the game, and are getting into it via the shiny new Apple-sanctioned distribution channel?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Sure, we’ve got a lot of iPad apps coming “Back to the Mac”. Apparently the refactor from magical touch-screen device to revolutionary and finely tuned desktop computer isn’t that difficult, and there are all kinds of Angry Birds on the mac now.<a href="#footnote_4_1120" title="Angry Birds just looks stupid on a 23” screen, by the way">5</a> But what about the rest of the store? Well, it’s…the kind of thing we’ve come to expect on the iOS app store. A tiny little app that costs you $.99 and lets you track your weight is acceptable on a phone, but it just looks stupid on a desktop. So what happened? Why aren’t we getting the kind of buy-in to the Mac App Store that made the iOS App Store such a huge deal and spawned a thousand copycats? Let’s look at it from the software creator’s point of view.</p>

<h3>A Day in the Life of a Developer</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>So there you are, a fervent Apple fan boy or girl who has the best possible idea for a new app: the Kittenizer. Soon people worldwide will be posting pictures made better by the artistic and subtle addition of giant Impact-font additions to their images, all drawn from their Twitter and Facebook feeds. The muse grips you, and you must get your program out to the world. But how?</p>

<p>Well, who’s your audience? If you want to write in a cross-platform language, like Java or Flex, then you’re locked out of the Mac App Store. No big deal, you’ll write a Windows version later.</p>

<p>So, that means you’re learning Cocoa and Objective-C. Cool. So you start writing your app, and genius that you are, you have it ready to go in less than eight hours.<a href="#footnote_5_1120" title="I called this section “A Day in the Life” and I mean to stick to it. Even if it means becoming really really implausible in the process.">6</a> Your beta testers<a href="#footnote_6_1120" title="your mom, your sister, and your sister’s boyfriend">7</a> all rave about the app, and it hasn’t had a major crash in <em>minutes</em>. So now you’re off to the races! Let’s get that App in the App Store and out where everyone can know the joy of your buzzword-powered masterpiece.</p>

<p>Not so fast! First you need to cough up $99. Just like the iOS Store, there’s a bar that says “you must be this well off to ride this ride” before you get into the Magic Kingdom. So you go to your beta testers and some other friends and scrape together the money, pay Apple, and make your way through their steps to get your product out there. And after you submit your app, you sit back, looking forward to the moment when your app goes on sale, when you’re getting rewarded for your brilliance. How knows, maybe you’ll even end up as a featured app, or maybe you’ll get a huge award at next year’s WWDC! Maybe your app will even get–</p>

<p>Rejected.</p>

<p>What? Why? You scan the email, and, it’s insanely vague. Don’t worry, young one, you’re <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1854/marsedit-3-2-2">not alone</a>. Still undeterred, you spend a few minutes getting Sparkle built into your app<a href="#footnote_7_1120" title="it doesn’t require any code changes, it lives in Interface Builder">8</a> and a few hours setting up a system that handles activations and whatnot. Finally, just before midnight the Kittenizer is up and for sale on your own personal website.</p>

<h3>In the End…</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>It looks like we’re really really down on the Mac App Store. And while we don’t think it’s the best idea in the world, it’s not entirely terrible. But a platform that’s antagonistic to both the developer <em>and</em> the customer is a platform that could use some more love and attention, or else it’s going to end up like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_Software#Zune_Marketplace">Zune Marketplace</a>, and nobody wants that.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week we seek for some solace in nostalgia with the advent of <a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a>, a skinnable iTunes controller.</p>

<p>Q: A What-able what now? What is the madness you are saying with your face?</p>

<p>A: Oh, come on, we were all there. Remember the early 2000’s when you were finally able to play music on your computer, and you had all these cool skins for your music player?</p>

<p>Q: No.</p>

<p>A: Sure you do. You could make it look like a brain, and the buttons were made out of wrinkles on the brain’s surface, or you could have it look like a big piano with the control buttons outlined on the keys, or whatever.</p>

<p>Q: Nope!</p>

<p>A: Wow, did you miss out. All the music players did it. Windows Media Player, Winamp, RealPlayer…</p>

<p>Q: All windows programs you’ll notice.</p>

<p>A: Er, well, see, I didn’t get my first mac until 2006, so…</p>

<p>Q: Well, for those of us who have always used good computers we’ve used boring, gray old iTunes and liked it. We don’t need your silly skinnable thingies.</p>

<p>A: But look, you’ve got a chance now! Bowtie is free in the Mac App Store, and you can have a little player that shows you what album you’re listening to, has all your controls, and is really really out of the way AND cool looking, all at the same time!</p>

<p>Q: I don’t really see the point…</p>

<p>A: AND it lets you love or ban songs on Last.fm, so people know what you think about the music you’re listening to! That’s something we couldn’t do back in the day, back with dumb ol’ web 1.0</p>

<p>Q: So there really isn’t a point.</p>

<p>A: The point is to have fun! Come on, it’s spring! The sky is bright, life is good, maybe you should loosen up a bit too! Sometimes things can just be fun. I’m using it to listen to the Tron: Legacy soundtrack right now, just because I can!</p>

<p>Q: Hmmm, not sure I can lower my standards of “fun” quite that far.</p>

<p>A: *sigh*. Okay, Mr. Boring Pants. Go watch your news programs and listen to your collection of the 100 greatest renditions of <em>4&#8217;.33&#8221;</em> I’ll catch you later.</p>

<p>Q: What’s wrong with <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4'33%22">4&#8217;33&#8221;</a></em>?</p>

<p>A: Oh, it’s nothing.<a href="#footnote_0_1119" title="I couldn’t resist">1</a></p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Answered Questions and answers to help you, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This week, it’s all about Twitter’s creatively named Twitter client: Twitter for Mac <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#stupidname">#stupidname</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/Ilikehashtags">#Ilikehashtags</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: So what’s the big deal with Twitter in the first place? Lots of short messages flying around all over the place, forcing people to abbrev</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Ah, so we’re doing that, are we? all our questions and answers have to be less than 140 characters?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yep! It’ll help you stop whinging( on about stupid crap. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#justsayin">#justsayin</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: So the point is to get us all to distill the essence of what we want to say, to refine our thinking and use every letter effectively?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, I think originally it was just because that was the length of a standard text message. <a href="http://twitter.com/Pogue">@Pogue</a> would know. He’s like, a Twitter god.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: 138, 139, 140. Wow, you’re way too good at getting EXACTLY 140 characters in there. Should I be scared?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Why? It’s just a way to communicate with people, and get a sense of what’s going on in the world around us.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Okay, whatever. I’m going to allow–for the moment–that Twitter has validity as a form of communication. But why do I need an app?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, it makes it easier to see what’s happened in your feed, post replies…</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Easier than going to a web site? That does the exact same thing?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, for one thing, the app wastes far less screen space with stupid things like <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#trendingtopics">#trendingtopics</a>. Seriously, I hate those.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: And yet you linked to a discussion about them. Odd.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yeah, sorry about that. It gets to be a habit after a while. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#Ijustcannotstopmyself">#Ijustcannotstopmyself</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Yeah, I’m still not sold. Not just on the client either. I don’t see a real point for Twitter in general.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, there’s not much I can say to change your mind. It’s all free, so you can try it out, see if you like it.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: The name is very appropriate: there’s a lot of tweets, like birds in a tree, but they’re all really short and not a big deal. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#nobigdeal">#nobigdeal</a></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Almost thou convincest me to become a…what exactly? Tweeter? Twit? Bird?</p>

<p>A: Yeah, nobody’s really sure. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/#ohwell">#ohwell</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Completely non-shocking news from Cupertino today as it’s revealed that only around 40% of <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> Employees actually <em>use</em> Apple’s new <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/ping/">Ping</a> service.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem to be very useful,” said Pre Tend, who asked to remain nameless. “I tried it for a while, but none of my friends are on there, and everybody’s already on Facebook. So I just use that.”</p>

<p>“I go through the motions. I mean, I’ll review a song or two every so often,” said P. Schilller, who asked that we not identify him in this article. “Just to keep Steve and Tim happy, you know. I’ll review a song or something. But really, who wants everyone to know when they’re listening to <em>Inna Gadda Da Vida</em> for the fifth time that day? Er, not that I’ve done that. I think…I think Scott does that.”</p>

<p>There are others who say that the service provides a vibrant link between fans and artists, and that it’s just getting started. Unfortunately we were unable to reach any of them for comment. Officially, Apple remains confident that Ping will eventually be like Facebook without the freedom. When asked for a comment on the results of the study, an Apple spokesperson said “hey that’s 40% than the national average! So things are looking up!”</p>

<p><strong>Schiller:</strong> Why are we worrying about how you say it? We should just worry about the fact that Scott keeps singing over my lines!</p>

<p><em>[everyone starts talking at once. Jony Ive seems to just be saying “rhubarb, rhubarb!” over and over again]</em></p>

<p><strong>Cook: </strong>Listen, Listen! Guys, we’ve got to get this right!</p>

<p><strong>Schiller: </strong>Okay, sorry, Tim. We’re ready this time.</p>

<p>At first, it just doesn’t make sense. <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> is selling, <em>selling</em> XCode, that amazing—and previously free—programmer’s delight of an IDE that is the gateway to the riches of putting your programs in the App Stores.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, XCode 4 is a massive improvement on the previous versions, with everything integrated into a single window, a massive improvement on the previous versions’ tendency to spread windows over your entire desktop and eventually into other Spaces, just because there are so dang many of them. The new debugger is faster, more intuitive, gives you good stack traces, even on multiple threads, and actually tries to trace your local variables and display them in a way that makes sense to humans, again something at which XCode 3 struggled.</p>

<p>So many of us purchased XCode 4 from the app store, telling ourselves that, considering how much Windows developers pay for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/premium">Visual Studio</a> we were getting off easy. And we downloaded the 4.5 Gigabyte file, and we ran the installer, and everything was good. XCode 4 was installed! Life was happy. Blithely we deleted the Installer file that the App Store dropped into our Applications folders and started tinkering around with all the new features, like Git integration and a useful timeline view of code changes and whatnot.</p>

<p>Then, a few days later, Apple released version 4.0.1 of the app. Well, we had noticed a few things that were kinda buggy with the initial release, so that’s to be expected. We go into the App Store, expecting an upgrade notification and…nothing. The App Store says we haven’t installed XCode 4. But look! It’s running right there! Lo and behold, deleting the 4.5 Gigabyte installer file from our Applications folder is what told the App Store that we no longer had XCode on our drive. So we download the new version—all 4.5 Gigabytes of it—and reinstall. The awful truth dawns slowly: we have to keep that stupid installer file to get our “convenient” automatic updates.</p>

<p>This, I feel, is too coincidental. It is clearly a joke, played upon the Apple developer community and their ISP’s. Apple is too smart to saddle their developers with a gigantic dead weight file and massive downloads for every patch release. Fortunately, they’ve given us some clues. Look at the version number: <strong>4.0.1</strong>. Does that suggest anything to you? Looks a lot like 4/1, doesn’t it? Yep, it’s an April Fool’s day joke.</p>

<p>Okay, Apple, you’ve had your fun. Now let’s make with version 4.0.2 getting rid of the annoyance factors. I’ve got better uses for that huge chunk of hard drive space. Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Cupertino <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> announced today that they are “concerned” that the number of Full-Screen Writing Programs may soon be more than the Apple Ecosystem can handle, and that they will be declaring an “Open Season” on the little blighters.</p>

<p>“It started out innocently enough,” said Sina Tamaddon, VP of Applications at Apple, Inc. “We had <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>, which was a nice little app. I mean, get serious, it’s TextEdit stretched out and colored. But really, no harm done. Later some of the bigger writing apps, like Ulysses and <a href="http://literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a> added full screen views. Heck, we added it to Pages. But now these little full-screen text editor programs are popping up like mice. <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">OmmWriter Dana</a> added some pretty music and background graphics, but this new <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>? It’s like Pages on the iPad for the Mac. We should have come up with that!</p>

<p>“The full-Screen Writing program epidemic is a small part of the larger threat,” said Dr. Weisman, a made-up pompous guy with leather patches on his elbows. No, no tweed jacket. “Like any ecosystem, the Mac app ecosystem needs to maintain a delicate balance. Too many graphics programs and the businessmen wander off. Too many spreadsheets, and there go all your artists,” at this point Weisman started to giggle. “I’m just kidding. Artists would be eaten alive on a PC. Two seconds after they brought it home it’d be so full of viruses and spyware they’d have to unplug it and take the battery out just to get it to stop shouting obscene phrases at them. But that’s beside the point. The point is, the number of writing programs currently in the mac ecosystem is threatening that delicate balance. Scrivener, we’ve got nothing against Scrivner. And <a href="http://pagehand.com/">Pagehand</a>, we like Pagehand.<a href="#footnote_0_1111" title="Apparently Dr. Weisman also likes repeating himself.">1</a> But these newcomers are starting to crowd out the long-standing, upstanding, outstanding old guys like <a href="http://www.nisus.com/">NisusWriter</a> or <a href="http://www.redlers.com/">Mellel</a>. Sure, the new ones are easy to use. But they don’t have history, or deep roots, and they don’t keep people from flowing downhill into PC territory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly,” Tamaddon said, wresting control back from the somewhat creepy doctor. “so, starting in the summer of 2011, we will be selling tags for hunters to remove certain Full-Screen Writing programs from the ecosystem. We want to make sure it’s done humanely, no porting a program to Linux or anything like that. We’re thinking that tags will begin at $40, after you join the Apple Hunter Program, which is quite reasonable at $99/year, and includes a license for XCode 4.”</p>

<p>Tamaddon mentioned that Scott Forstall would be monitoring this program closely, and if it proved successful would be offering a similar system for “all those dang iOS ToDo list apps.”</p>
