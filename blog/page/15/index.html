<p>Early this morning, every member of the Apple “community”<a href="#footnote_0_513" title="defined as “people who care about OS updates”">1</a> started vibrating at about 20Hz.</p>

<p>“It’s coming!” they<a href="#footnote_1_513" title="alright, “we”">2</a> said in unison at 6:45 PDT.  Several people were heard to growl like cats.<br />
“The 28th! That’s only (carry the one…add three…) seven days from today! No, wait, FOUR! that’s four days from now!” squealed Walt Mossberg, immediately starting his glowing review of the nascent OS. <br />
“What? I’ve been running snow leopard for two [expeletive deleted] years now.  No big deal,” said John Gruber.<br />
For those of us that don’t get free beta copies of unreleased releases, Friday is now officially a big deal™.  We’ll keep you posted on further developments in the community’s response as they happen.</p>

<p>Today we look at MAMP: the german server software for you.</p>

<p>Q: Apple lied to me, man!</p>

<p>A: How’s that again?</p>

<p>Q: They said every Mac has all the software needed to be a web server built in.</p>

<p>A: Which is true.</p>

<p>Q: Except for PHP, man! I wrote a php website and it totally didn’t get served. No service! Web server fail, I say!</p>

<p>A: Easy there, oddly phrased hippie person! So, you turned on the “Web Sharing” thing…</p>

<p>Q: …Put a php file in my “sites” folder…</p>

<p>A: …And it didn’t do what you wanted. Yeah, been there. There’s two ways to deal with that.</p>

<p>Q: Yeah? what are they?</p>

<p>A: First, you could just edit the Apache configuration file to load the php module</p>

<p>Q: You lost me at “edit”.</p>

<p>A: Or you could download MAMP.</p>

<p>Q: What’s that? It sounds like someone with the mumps saying mump.</p>

<p>A: Don’t be weird. MAMP is a program that gives you a Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP web server. So you can do all your awesome server side scripting simply.</p>

<p>Q: Sweet!</p>

<p>A: Sure! Simply start several servers… okay, enough alliteration. MAMP sets up a local copy of PHP, MySQL and Apache that all runs separate and apart from the bulit-in “web sharing” server, so you can hack away at it’s config files and not screw up your mac. It makes it much easier to turn your MacBook into a development server.</p>

<p>Q: Wait, what? My MacBook? What about my iBook?</p>

<p>A: Sure. It’s Universal.</p>

<p>Q: Cosmic.</p>

<p>This week: all of the SSB’s you could handle, all in one go!</p>

<p>Q: What’s an SSB?</p>

<p>A: Depending on who you ask, it’s either a Site Specific Browser or a Single Site Browser. </p>

<p>Q: Which means…</p>

<p>A: A fad. Travel with me back through the mists of time to 2007…</p>

<p>Q: What? No!, hey, I said I’d never go back! Stop it… Oh, we’re there.</p>

<p>A: Yes. As you can see, the world is still prosperous and people are still willing to support any open source project, no matter how idiotic.</p>

<p>Q: *Sigh* Were we really ever so carefree?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Now, here at Mozilla headquarters, they are about to begin a board meeting to discuss a new product called Mozilla Prism, which lets you “split” one web app off of the main web, much like a non-Mozilla prism splits white light into many colors</p>

<p>Mozilla Stormtrooper 1: Hey, you’re not allowed in the board meeting!</p>

<p>Mozilla Bartender: No Blasters!</p>

<p>Q: Shouldn’t we run?</p>

<p>A: Didn’t you read the iFAQ? he’s a <em>Stormtrooper</em>. He can’t hit us. (Blaster fire continues around the principle characters as they talk) </p>

<p>Q: Oh, yeah, right.</p>

<p>A: Anyway, when people who made browsers started noticing that there were websites that were more like applications than just collections of pages, they thought it would be awesome if you could a have a program that let you interact with these “web apps” just like desktop apps. So they started creating said programs. Generally, you would give the program an URL, and it would give you back a stripped down browser with the site’s favicon as the browser’s icon.</p>

<p>Q: … Why?</p>

<p>A: Apparently they felt that when some people need their MySpace fix<a href="#footnote_0_509" title="remember, this is 2007">1</a> they can’t take all the time needed to open a regular browser and click on a bookmark.</p>

<p>Q: Yes, I can see how that might take…three seconds.</p>

<p>A: Indeed. So SSB’s were born. And since they were introduced as a TLA<a href="#footnote_1_509" title="“Three letter acronym”.  Unless you think it’s “Three-letter-abbreviation”">2</a> people instantly decided to split into two groups about what “SSB” stands for.</p>

<p>Q: So what does it stand for?</p>

<p>A: Every human’s right to surf the web as they please!</p>

<p>Q: …. That was a joke, was it?</p>

<p>A: Look, I already answered that question at the beginning of the iFAQ.</p>

<p>Q: Ah, but the beginning of the iFAQ is in 2009, and we’re still in 2007! And we still have this storm trooper shooting at us.</p>

<p>Mozilla Stormtrooper: Die, semi-closed-semi-open-source Apple scum!</p>

<p>A: Right, right. Okay, back to 2009 we go.</p>

<p>Q: Thank you. So what happened to SSBs in the meanwhile?</p>

<p>A: They’re still out there, but all the open source support has been shifted to slightly less trendy projects. And making closed-source iPhone apps that do the exact same thing, then selling them for 99 cents.</p>

<p>Q: Makes “cents”. Hee hee hee.</p>

<p>Mozilla Stormtrooper: [Fires a ‘stun’ blast]</p>

<p>Q: [falls down]</p>

<p>MS: He’ll be all right. Inform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Baker">Lady Baker</a> that we found a pun-maker. </p>

<p>Apple’s Phil Schilller has recently been sending <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/160726521/on-saturday-night-we-drove-up-to-seattle-to">polite emails</a> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/06/apples_schiller_personally_responds_to_app_store_criticism.html">to bloggers</a> who have problems with the iPhone, which is good. But none of these missives have dealt with the main problem we here at CANS have with the high-tech device, so we’re going to rant about it here until Apple takes action.<a href="#footnote_0_504" title="Or we get a nice email from a senior executive.">1</a> Because that’s the kind of public-spirited, watchdog source of invented news we are.</p>

<p>So, Apple talks about their commitment to the developers and iPhone owners. They have demonstrated their drive to make the iPhone the number one personal communications device through excellent marketing. They built an easy-to-shop<a href="#footnote_1_504" title="but somewhat less easy-to-stock">2</a> App Store, and continued in their tried and true pattern of making truly excellent products.  But they have missed one key element, one essential piece of the puzzle that, if left unchecked, will be the entire downfall of the iPhone’s empire, and we call upon Apple to set it right at all costs. <a href="#footnote_2_504" title="Free mixed metaphors,5-7pm nightly">3</a></p>

<p>The problem is this: Nobody at CANS has an iPhone!  None of the Ruby Ninja Androids, not Nate, not….well, that’s the whole staff, really.  But none of us are iPhone owners, and if Apple doesn’t take drastic steps to remedy this situation we will be forced, as Steven Frank was, to utterly boycott the iPhone.  Needless to say, this will lead to the sort of financial problems that shuttered other great companies. For example, nobody at CANS was a customer at Enron, and look what happened to them!  And the same thing is true of Apple products:  Know why the Newton died? <em>Because not a single CANS editor owned one!</em> Case closed!</p>

<p>And yet Apple continues, blithely ignoring this threat to the very existence of their beloved iPhone, not doing the one simple thing that would put them on sure, solid ground: sending us a free iPhone 3GS and paying our AT&amp;T contract for a year.  We estimate that this one simple, cost effective move would ensure a 100% increase in the iPhone’s market share<a href="#footnote_3_504" title="at CANS HQ">4</a>.</p>

<p>We call upon Apple to rectify this situation immediately.<a href="#footnote_4_504" title="or at the very least have Mr. Schiller send us a nice email explaining that they’ve taken our views on board and are considering it.">5</a></p>

<p>Martyn Williams, who surely had better things to do, chose instead to write about the <a href="http://bit.ly/LbSya">downfall of tr.im</a>, a nearly unknown url shortener, who sought to compete with the equally stupid sounding <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>, and the almost-longer-than-the-original <a href="http://readthisurl.com">readthisurl.com</a>. And we here at CANS are glad he did, as we were all set to launch into the beta testing phase of our own url shortening website.  We had already run into a few snags with our program, not the least of which was the fact that our “shortened” urls were promising to look something like “http://crazyapplenews.com/shortening/index.php/sle4231xfSEslkeyggiotr78Cvdew” <a href="#footnote_0_500" title="I was going to actually make that link live, but decided at the last moment not to do three hours of coding and testing for a one-line throw away gag">1</a></p>

<p>We will now observe a minute of silence for the fallen tr.im, shortened to three seconds, as they would have wanted it.  </p>

<p>Apple’s not-actually-announced-yet-but-it’s-totally-real-guys-seriously tablet device will be able to everything you ever wanted ever, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/07/apples_tablet_will_be_more_than_a_niche_product_report.html">predict many sources</a>.</p>

<p>“This device will be usable by everyone everywhere. It will have 3G speeds on EDGE networks, and freeway gas mileage even in downtown NYC! Millions of starving children in Ghana will be able to use it to do their classwork without learning Linux or SmallTalk on one of those ghetto green lappy things,” asserted John Gruber, Walt Mosseberg, and David Pogue, in unison. Pogue continued, “And then the Enterprise will show up because we finally built a <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/PADD">PADD</a>, just like the one Wesley Crusher used!”<a href="#footnote_0_496" title="Pogue actually speaks with hyperlinks like that. It’s kinda freaky.  But very web 2.0">1</a> However, this is not predicted to have any effect on <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/">Will Wheaton’s</a> Whining Ways<a href="#footnote_1_496" title="WWWWWA? (What Would Will Wheaton Whine About?) ">2</a></p>

<p>“Dude, I stopped whining about leaving Star Trek when I wrote that “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Just-Geek-Wil-Wheaton/dp/059600768X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1249656558&amp;sr=8-1">Geek</a>” book,” Wheaton said. But we were busy trying to get back to the point of this article.</p>

<p>Steve Ballmer was dismissive of the as yet unannounced high-technology device, claiming that the beta weather-control module was “only 89% effective at re-structuring storm systems” and the “code for the lead-to-gold transmogrifier is really ugly. Hey Apple, the Dark Ages called, they want their technology back!” When pressed<a href="#footnote_2_496" title="not a task for the faint of heart">3</a> Ballmer admitted that he “hadn’t actually seen either of these components,” but he was “totally sure that they would suck, just like the iPhone”.</p>

<p>Not so, says every other technology news site ever. According to “trusted sources” quoted by the rest of the web, the new iSlate/iTab/MacSlate/McRib/MacTablet/MacPlate will have the following features: 
*   Telepathy
*   Gorgeous new interface based on supermodels
*   Gorgeous new supermodels based on the interface
*   Gorgeous new Phil Schiller
*   the first ever 8-finger “gesture”
*   8 actual fingers
*   Side of fries
*   Web cam
*   Super-advanced webcam software that prevents users from posting embarrassing videos to YouTube
*   Quick<em>er</em>Time
*   FREE PONY!</p>

<p>And several thousand other amazing features.</p>

<p>the new product is expected to be released every day from today until somtime next year.</p>

<p>This week: TextMate, the emacs of the GUI world</p>

<p>Q: That was a terrible analogy, you know.</p>

<p>A: It’s valid: emacs is practically an OS in its own right, and TextMate is basically the entire Ruby programming language masquerading as a text editor.</p>

<p>Q: That doesn’t make it good. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin’s law</a> may be valid, but that doesn’t make me less inclined to smack people who mention it upside the head.</p>

<p>A: You’re awfully opinionated for a “Q:”, you know.</p>

<p>Q: Well, you got my back up. I mean, what do you want? You say that my beloved baby TextMate isn’t as awesome as some crufty ol’ emacs, and expect me to be happy about it?</p>

<p>A: Ummm… Can I speak frankly for a moment?</p>

<p>Q: I’m the “Q:” around here! Stop asking me questions!</p>

<p>A: Fine. You ask some.</p>

<p>Q: …Alright. What were you going to say? But it can’t be a question!</p>

<p>A: Okay…um…, okay here goes: I’ve noticed and often wondered about the odd <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000270.html">relationships</a> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/169673/the_end_of_the_road_for_a_favored_text_editor.html">web designers</a> <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=51430">seem to form</a> <a href="http://thomer.com/vi/vi.html">with their text editors</a>. Indeed, I have often wondered why this seems to happen so often to web designers in particular.</p>

<p>Q: So you suspect that web developers are strangely–</p>

<p>A: Perhaps unnaturally–</p>

<p>Q: Attached to their plain-text-with-syntax-higlights programs, is that it?</p>

<p>A: Yes.</p>

<p>Q: Because you totally aren’t a web programmer at all.</p>

<p>A: Right.</p>

<p>Q: And you could happily use any text editor under the sun, up to and including notepad.exe.</p>

<p>A: ….</p>

<p>Q: Right?</p>

<p>A: …. …..</p>

<p>Q: <em>Riiiight</em>?</p>

<p>A: ….Gaaaaaah! No! Not notepad! IneedmyOSXandTextMateorBBEditorevenKomodoifIhavetoworkonWindowsorLinuxpleasedon’tmakemeusenotepadpleasepleaseplease…</p>

<p>Q: Uh huh.</p>

<p>A: *pant* *pant* *pant*</p>

<p>Q: There there. Now, doesn’t that feel better? </p>

<p>A: A…A little.</p>

<p>Q: Good. Now maybe we can deal with the other problem.</p>

<p>A: What other problem?</p>

<p>Q: Having too many plain-text-with-syntax-highlighting text editors.</p>

<p>Apple humor columnists have been laid a stymie recently with Microsoft’s announcement that they will be opening their own retail outlets.<br />
“The problem isn’t having something to say about these impending train wrecks,” said <a href="http://www.macalope.com/2009/07/24/magnificent-desolation/">the Macalope</a>, “the problem is knowing where to <em>begin</em>. It’s like trying to take a brand new Mac Pro and a 30″ Cinema Display out to your brand-new luxury sedan. You just can’t leave anything behind, but you don’t want to carry it all, in case you drop something.”</p>

<p>“This is more ground than any of us can cover alone,” cried John Moltz, proposing a new joint humor campaign to fully exploit the comedic potential of the guaranteed failure. However, the erstwhile <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/">CARS</a> editor-in-chief then realized that starting and abandoning <a href="http://www.technologywhiskeysexy.com/">yet</a> <a href="http://www.apocatips.com/">another</a> blog would cut drastically into his time spent drinking sexy techno-whisky, and decided to cut out the middleman and abandon the plan instead. </p>

<p>“They haven’t got a [expletive deleted] snowball’s chance in [incredibly long string of expletives deleted]” ranted<a href="http://daringfireball.net/"> John Gruber</a>, who isn’t a humor columnist <em>per se</em>, but is still pretty funny.</p>

<p>Fortunately, while those of us who are dedicated to making light of all things Apple were overcome by the majesty of Microsoft’s proposed flop, others were able to <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/7/20/">handle the situation with aplomb</a>. From all of us to both of you, our thanks.</p>

<p>Every Friday we publish a list of inFrequently Asked Questions and answers to help you, the Crazy Apple user, get more out of your Crazy Apple products.</p>

<p>This Week: Plex: all media for ever and ever amen.</p>

<p>Q: I hate Front Row!</p>

<p>A: Fight the power!</p>

<p>Q: All it shows me is things I already have!</p>

<p>A: And trailers!</p>

<p>Q: I want something that shows me something else. Something new!</p>

<p>A: Something strange…</p>

<p>Q: Something different…</p>

<p>A: Poorly made YouTube parodies of famous songs…</p>

<p>Q: Low-bitrate movies…</p>

<p>A: The last five episodes of “The Simpsons”…</p>

<p>Q: Web Comics…</p>

<p>A: And most of all, I want it to hijack the Apple Remote!</p>

<p>Q: Like stealing a Jedi’s Lightsaber! </p>

<p>A: Yeah!…Er, no, no, that doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>Q: And we were doing so well. Oh well.</p>

<p>A: We were. So, to sum up: you want a multi-media powerhouse on your Mac. </p>

<p>Q: Yes. And it needs to be tastefully done.</p>

<p>A: Of course. </p>

<p>Q: And not too expensive.</p>

<p>A: Right, right.</p>

<p>Q: And with a little path…</p>

<p>A: Look, just say “ni!” and get it over with, alright? I ain’t cutting anything down with a herring.</p>

<p>Q: I uh, I don’t know what you’re talking about…</p>

<p>A: Riiiiight. Anyway, I think I can solve your problem.</p>

<p>Q: Great! That’ll save me thousands in therapy costs.</p>

<p>A: Maybe not that problem.</p>

<p>Q: Oh well. Doctor said we could cut back to three sessions a week if I promise not to say the words “penguin on your TV” this week…drat.</p>

<p>A: …Aaaaaanyway, What you want is Plex! That’s right Plex, with new addititve GLC 9424075<a href="#footnote_0_486" title="after 6 p.m., 9424048">1</a> …</p>

<p>Q: whose side are you on? Stop that! And anyway, it’s “after 6 p.m., 942404<em>7</em>“, not <em>8</em></p>

<p>A: My mistake. Anyway, Plex, regardless of additives, is an open-source media thingy. It hijacks your Apple Remote, lets you watch YouTube and Hulu and Netflix and all that stuff–</p>

<p>Q: That sounds exactly perfect!</p>

<p>A: And only crashes about once every three launches.</p>

<p>Q: Not so perfect, then.</p>

<p>A: Not yet, no. But with your continued support of the project, soon Plex will be giving Front Row a run for it’s money in both the features category and the non-sucking category!</p>

<p>Q: what do you mean by “support”?</p>

<p>A: Oh, just any little gesture of appreciation… you know, anything you can do…</p>

<p>Q: I’m afraid I don’t follow you…</p>

<p>A: Look, couldn’t you just give them a dollar?</p>

<p>Q: Yes, but you see, I don’t know what it’s for.</p>

<p>A: Well, they’ll use it to help other people work on Plex.</p>

<p>Q: No, no, no, I don’t follow this at all, I mean, I don’t want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I’m a dollar down on the whole deal.</p>

<p>A: Gotcha!</p>

<p>Q: … Drat.</p>
